Nyt,https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/cookie-policy#how-do-i-manage-trackers,"Skip to ContentThe New York TimesThe Times and your DataMain MenuPrivacy F.A.Q.Privacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage SettingsEnglishEnglishEspañol简体中文The Times and Your DataCookie PolicyThe Times and Your DataThe trust of our readers is essential.The New York Times Company Cookie PolicyLast revised on September 9, 2024This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking methods (such as pixels, SDKs, JavaScript, local storage, device identifiers, etc., which we refer to as “trackers”) when you visit our site. “Our site” means our websites, emails, apps and other services that link to this Cookie Policy, like nytimes.com and its subdomains, including The Athletic and Wirecutter.This policy explains what various tracking methods are, and why they are used. It also explains your right to control their use.We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Check the “last revised” date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any change becomes effective when we post the revised Cookie Policy on or through our site.Where we use trackers to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, our Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.If you have any questions, please contact us by email at privacy@nytimes.com. You can also write to us: The New York Times Company, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, attn.: Legal Department. If you have any questions regarding The Athletic, please contact The Athletic at privacy@theathletic.com.Page Contents1What Is a Tracker?2What Trackers Do We Use And For Which Purpose?3How Do I Manage Trackers?1.What Is a Tracker?We use a variety of tracker methods; six of the main types are explained below.This list is intended to include all categories that we use, although the categories may vary depending on the use of our site.We use trackers to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the services through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base so that we can improve our services and your experience.We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through trackers with other personal information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.Please reference the descriptions below to learn more about the kinds of trackers we use and for what purpose.A) CookiesA cookie is a small string of text that a website (or online service) stores on a user’s browser. It saves data on your browser about your visit to our site or other sites. It often includes a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123).“First-party cookies” are cookies set by us (or on our behalf) on our site. “Third-party cookies” are cookies set by other companies whose functionality is embedded into our site (e.g., google.com).“Session cookies” are temporary cookies stored on your device while you visit our site. They expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” are stored on your browser for a period of time after you leave our site. Persistent cookies expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually.We use persistent cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit. This allows us, for example, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our services, how often you return, how your use of the services may vary over time, to target advertising, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services and customize your online experience.You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. However, if cookies are refused, your experience on our site may be worse, and some features may not work as intended.B)PixelsPixels (also known as “web beacons,” “GIFs” or “bugs”) are one-pixel transparent images located on web pages or messages. They track whether you have opened these web pages or messages. Upon firing, a pixel logs a visit to the current page or message and may read or set cookies.Pixels often rely on cookies to work, so turning off cookies can impair them. But even if you turn off cookies, pixels can still detect a web page visit.C) JavascriptJavaScript is a programming language. It can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our site and other sites.D)Software Development Kits (or SDKs)SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., third-party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps to collect and analyze certain device and user data.E)Device IdentifiersDevice identifiers are user-resettable identifiers comprised of numbers and letters. They are unique to a specific device. They are stored directly on the device. They are used to recognize you and/or your devices(s) on, off and across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes.F)ID SynchingIn order to decide what type of ad might interest you, our digital and marketing vendors sometimes link data — inferred from your browsing of other sites or collected from other sources — using a method knowns as “ID synching” or “cookie synching.” To do this, they match the tracker ID they have assigned to you with one or more tracker IDs that are held in another company’s database and that are likely also associated with you. Any of the linked trackers may have certain interests and other demographic information attributed to it. That information is then used to determine which ad to show you.Back to top2.What Trackers Do We Use And For Which Purpose?Below is a list of the types of trackers that appear on our site.Essential TrackersEssential trackers are required for our site to operate and to provide you with the features or services that you have requested. They allow you to navigate our site and use its services and features (e.g., cookies that help you stay logged in). Without essential trackers, our site will not run smoothly; in fact, our site (or certain services or features) might not even be available to you simply because of technical limitations.Analytics TrackersAnalytics trackers collect or use information about your site use, which helps us improve our site. Among the uses of analytics trackers are to show us which pages are most frequently visited, help us record difficulties you have with our site, track subscription purchases and behaviors leading to subscription purchases, and measure how well ads perform.These trackers add up our readers’ visits to show us larger patterns in our audience. We look at these larger patterns to analyze site traffic.Marketing TrackersThese trackers help us determine which ads to show you for Times properties — both on our site and on other sites. To do this, these trackers use information about your behavior on various sites to target our ads.These trackers allow us to limit the number of times you see our ad across your devices. They help us personalize the ads we show you. They also enable us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (e.g., measure if you subscribe after seeing our ads).Advertising TrackersAdvertising trackers help us and our advertising partners to determine which ads from third parties are selected for you. Some of these trackers collect or use information about your behavior and browsing habits on our services and other sites (including the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). They also collect your demographic details, interests and certain technical information about your browser or device to aid this targeting. These trackers sometimes limit the number of times you see an ad, make an ad more relevant to you or measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign. We may not have control or access to such trackers. If you look at one page on our services, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our services or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services.We work with advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors to serve these ads, who often use their own trackers through our site. The ads served can include additional trackers which are activated when an ad is visible to you or when you click on or otherwise interact with an ad.Back to top3.How Do I Manage Trackers?In certain jurisdictions, when you first come to our site, you will receive a banner notification that trackers are present. By clicking or tapping “accept all,” you agree to the use of these trackers as described here. You can manage your tracker settings at any time by clicking on “Manage Privacy Preferences” in our website footer or in your app “Privacy Settings”, or “Account Settings” for the Athletic app.In addition, you can refuse or accept trackers from our site (or any other site) in your browser’s settings. If you refuse trackers, you might not be able to sign in or use other tracker-dependent features of our site.Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but this is typically something you can adjust. Information for each browser can be found in the links below:Safari on desktopandSafari Mobile (iPhone and iPads): Note that, by default, Safari is engineered to protect you from being tracked from site to site unless you disable Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP).Firefox: By default, Firefox protects you from cross-site tracking so long as you have not disabled Total Cookie Protection. There is therefore less need to manage cookies to protect your privacy.ChromeMicrosoft Edge: Enabling tracking prevention with Edge will protect you from b"

Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address), as well as additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information that we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. In the limited circumstances in which we may process sensitive personal information as defined by applicable law, we process such information as permitted by and in compliance with applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or transforming it into information that does not identify you.

Some significant steps Asana takes to align its practices with the GDPR/UK GDPR include:Revising our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users to reflect legislative developments;Enhancing our security practices and procedures;Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share;Ensuring that we have robust internal privacy and security documentation;Training employees on global privacy requirements and privacy/security best practices;andThoughtfully building a data subject rights policy and response process.APACThe Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) is the primary data protection law in Japan that regulates the protection of personal information. It applies to business operators handling personal information of individuals in Japan. The APPI has been amended since it was originally enacted in 2003, with the most recent amendments coming into effect April 1, 2022.Similarly to the distinction between “data controllers” and “data processors” under the GDPR, the APPI makes a distinction between “business operators”—or entities with the authority to control and make decisions about retained personal information (i.e., Asana’s customers) and third-party service providers handling personal information on behalf of a business operator (i.e., Asana).The APPI also imposes restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information outside of Japan. Personal information may be transferred to overseas recipients if there are contractual agreements in place that ensure compliance with data protection standards in Japan.Asana is committed to processing and safeguarding personal information as required by the APPI and its amendments. Asana’sData Processing AddendumcoversOur data protection commitments to ensure that we comply with the APPI;How we will assist our customers with their obligations under the APPI; andThe technical and organizational measures implemented to protect personal information.For more information on Asana’s security and data protection practices, please see ourTrust Center.U.S. (federal and state)CaliforniaThe CCPA (as amended by CPRA) is a law that provides California consumers certain rights with respect to their personal information. Specifically, the law requires that businesses subject to the statute grant consumers the ability to request access to and deletion of their data, and the ability to opt out of certain types of disclosures of their personal information. The law also restricts how service providers that process personal information on behalf of a business may use that information.Where a business subject to the CCPA has entered into a service or subscription agreement with Asana, Asana will act as a service provider to that business. Specifically, Asana will process such customers’ personal information only for the purposes set forth in the applicable agreement and will cooperate with customers to fulfill their obligations with respect to deletion or access requests.Asana'sData Processing Addendumspecifically references our obligations under the CCPA. If your organization is a customer of Asana and requires an addendum, please reach out todpa@asana.com.HIPAAThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law in the United States that requires the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. Businesses that are subject to HIPAA can use Asana to support HIPAA-compliant work management.HIPAA compliance for Asana is governed byAsana’s Business Associate Addendum (BAA). For additional detail on HIPAA and Asana, please refer to theHIPAA Data Sheet.Gramm-Leach-Bliley ActThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. Service providers who are permitted by the financial institutions to access their consumers' nonpublic personal information (NPI) are also required to comply with GLBA. Asana is GLBA-ready and aligns our practices in accordance with GLBA's Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In addition to implementing security safeguards, we only use customer work content to provide our services, and not for any other purpose. Customers should not store sensitive personal data (including financial account numbers and social security numbers) in Asana.Family Educational Rights and Privacy ActThe Family Educ"

If you have received an invitation to join an Organization but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.2. Identifying the Data Controller and ProcessorData protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data. Whether Miro or Customer is the controller or processor of Personal Data depends on the type of data used and the purposes for such use.Customer is the controller for all Customer Content that is also Personal Data. As the controller, Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to an Organization, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove information and otherwise apply its policies to the Services. As the processor for Customer Content, Miro processes Customer Content that is Personal Data only on Customer’s request and in accordance with Customer’s written instructions, including the applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, Customer’s use of the Services, and as required by applicable law.

In some cases, our subsidiaries may be considered data controllers, either together with EA or by themselves.

ⓘ We collect information that you give us directly, such as when you create an EA Account, set up security questions, make purchases, or contact EA Help.
We collect information that you provide us, such as:
ⓘ When you play online, we may collect information about your gaming profile, your gameplay, or your use of social features.
When you use our social features, any text, audio, visual, and/or other electronic communications information that you disclose may be read, copied, collected, or used by other players and EA, and may become publicly available and/or may be processed by EA for the purposes described inSection 2(D): Anti-Cheat, Inappropriate Content, and Fraud Prevention Technologies. Please make sure your privacy settings and choices in the features you use reflect your preferences.
When you play our online games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are collected and some may be visible in-game, as well as visible to players outside the game in other EA Services, such as RaceNet. In some of our titles, we may record your gameplay and replay it to other players in-game and/or make it visible to other players outside the game in other EA Services. Leaderboards may also be available to view by other players outside the game in other EA Services. In competitive game modes, we may record your gameplay, and your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your in-game profile information and game statistics to other players in-game and at live EA or partner events.

We may collect other information automatically when you use our Services, such as:
