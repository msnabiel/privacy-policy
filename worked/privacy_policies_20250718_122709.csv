These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -740674ce2123e969123.45.67.89is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32is the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=carsis the requested URL, including the search query.Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7is the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalised advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more abouthow Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognise a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices and can bemanagedin your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customise our service to your device or analyse device issues related to our services.Additional ContextActivity on 3rd-party sites and apps that use our servicesWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, 3rd party sites, and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.You canlearn moreabout some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.Activity on Google ServicesIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for cafes while in Mumbai, Google might show results for Mumbai in future searches.You can view and control your Web & App Activity atMy Activity.ads you’ll find most usefulFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn moreabout Google adsandwhy you may see particular ads.advertising and research services on their behalfFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that do not reveal information about individual people.Android device with Google appsAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more aboutGoogle Play Services.customised search resultsFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You canlearn more here. You may also get customised search results even when you’re signed out. If you do not want this level of search customisation, you cansearch and browse privatelyor turn offsigned-out search personalisation.deliver our servicesExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube videoWe use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google AccountPhotos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.Learn moreA flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your GmailWhen you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us with information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.detect abuseWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (includingchild sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyse how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started, allows us to fix things more quickly.Information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or does not follow the correct process. Learn more in ourTransparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyse how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyse its traffic.Learn moreour usersFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyses these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.Learn more.partner with GoogleThere are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.Learn morepayment informationFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.Learn morePerformance of their ad campaigns.Learn moreabout the technologies used for advertising.personalised adsYou may also see personalised ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.Learn morephone numberIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.Learn morePlaces you label like home and workYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads.You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in yourGoogle Account.protect against abuseFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).publicly accessible sourcesFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.rely on cookies to function properlyFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.Learn moresafety and reliabilitySome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:Collecting and analysing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.Learn moresensitive categoriesWhen showing you personalised ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We do not use topics or show personalised ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And werequire the same from advertisersthat use our services.Sensor data from your deviceYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here . Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy. Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may: Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account . Register for an account without providing an email address or real name. Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you: Make public contributions . Register an account or update your user page. Use the Wikimedia Sites. Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback . We are committed to: Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy. Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure . Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes. Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites , to comply with the law , or to protect you and others . Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. Be aware: Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available . If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in , that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username. Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites. Introduction Use of info Sharing Protection Important info Introduction Welcome! The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia , Wikimedia Commons , and Wiktionary . This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information. We collect very little Personal Information about you. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties. By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy. The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial. We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important. We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you. After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive. Definitions Back to top We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like ""tracking pixels"" and ""cookies"" used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful. Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations: When we say... ...we mean: ""the Wikimedia Foundation"" / ""the Foundation"" / ""we"" / ""us"" / ""our"" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. ""Wikimedia Sites"" / ""our services"" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects , such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the ""What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover"" section below. ""you"" / ""your"" / ""me"" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. ""this Policy"" / ""this Privacy Policy"" This document, entitled the ""Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy"". ""contributions"" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. ""Personal information"" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be ""personal information"" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. ""third party"" / ""third parties"" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters , thematic organizations , and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients , and contractors of those organizations or groups. What This Privacy Policy Does and Does Not Cover Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below. Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language: All of our major sites (found at list of major projects ), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards. Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services). Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications. Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you. This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below. More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include: Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy ); donate.wikimedia.org , including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy ); and The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension , which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy . This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded. If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites. Administrative volunteers , such as CheckUsers or Stewards . These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy , as well as other, tool-specific policies. Tool providers . We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org . When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on. Other users . We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include: posting to Foundation-hosted email lists; requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info wikimedia.org goes to this system); emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the ""Email this user"" feature); and chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel). Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of: Websites run by other organizations , like websites linked to from the ""References"" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations . These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals . These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy wikimedia.org so we can investigate. Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy , the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy. Back to top Collection & Use of Info Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It Your Public Contributions Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone. When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the ""How We Use Information We Receive From You"" section of this Privacy Policy. Publicly Visible Information Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions. You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. Back to top Account Information & Registration You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site. If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the ""Email this user"" feature for example). If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address . Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem! You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device. If you want to create a standard account , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password. More on Usernames Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information. Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that. Back to top Location Information GPS & Other Location Technologies Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ . Back to top Metadata Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location . Back to top Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites. Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy. Back to top Information We Receive Automatically Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites. Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends. Back to top Information We Collect We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels , JavaScript , and a variety of ""locally stored data"" technologies, such as cookies and local storage . These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them. Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information. We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org . More on Locally Stored Data Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like: Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area. Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you. Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field. Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ . We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data. While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

We engage in these activities to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. Back to top Other Location information GPS & Other Location Technologies As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites. Back to top Metadata As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled ""For Legal Reasons"" and ""To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."" Back to top Sharing When May We Share Your Information? We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below. With Your Permission We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ . Back to top For Legal Reasons We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you. For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ . Back to top If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!) In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Back to top To Protect You, Ourselves & Others We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies; protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person. We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions. Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy . These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation. We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.) Back to top To Our Service Providers We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission. We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ . If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page . Back to top To Understand & Experiment We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites. When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest. The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites. When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ .) Back to top Because You Made It Public Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone. Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere. Back to top Protection How Do We Protect Your Personal Information? We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email . Back to top How Long Do We Keep Your Data? Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law. Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ .) Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines . Back to top Your rights If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us. For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ . If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us . We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law. Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences. Back to top Important info For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites. Where is the Foundation & What Does That Mean for Me? The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you. Back to top Our Response to Do Not Track (DNT) signals We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the ""When May We Share Your Information"" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes. Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's ""do not track"" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ . Back to top Changes to This Privacy Policy Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days. Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner: In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list. For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list. We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

Twitter,https://twitter.com,https://twitter.com/privacy,"X Privacy Policy We have made some updates to our Privacy Policy. This version of the Privacy Policy will go into effect on July 28, 2025. Until then, the current Privacy Policy continues to apply. Â Before you scroll, read this Itâs really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail. With that in mind, weâve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how itâs used, and when itâs shared.Â So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this: Â X is a public platform Learn whatâs viewable & searchable We collect some data about you LearnÂ what we collect & how Affiliate services may have their own policies Learn about affiliates We use your data to make X better Learn how we make your info work You can control your experience Learn how to update your settings If you have questions about how we use data, just ask Learn how to contact us Privacy Policy 1.

General 10. How To Contact X 1. Information We Collect The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories. 1.1 Information you provide us. To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services. Personal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, âCreatorsâ); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.Â Professional Accounts. If you create a professional account , you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.Â Payment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. Preferences. Â When you set your preferences using yourÂ settings , we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences. Biometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes. Job Applications / Recommendations. Â We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the âInformation we collect when you use Xâ section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising. 1.2 Information we collect when you use X. When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you. Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including: Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts youâve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of. Your interactions with other usersâ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts youâve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).

Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level. Your device address book, if youâve chosen to share it with us. Location Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where youâve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account. Inferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below: When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiï¬ers). When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X. When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect. Log Information.

Â Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. Â We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates , and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. 2. How We Use Information Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think itâs most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us . Here we go: 2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services. We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates , third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy. We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings , which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy. 2.2Â Foster safety and security. We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law. 2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better. We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better. 2.4 Communicate with you about our services. We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If youâre open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time. 2.5 Research. We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services. 3. Sharing Information You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information. 3.1 When you post and share. With the general public .Â You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings ). With other X users. Depending on your settings , and based on the X products and services you use, we share: Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow. Content you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages . Please keep in mind that if youâve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service. With partners. Â Depending on your settings , we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center . You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the âData sharing with business partnersâ option in your Privacy & Safety settings .Â (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.) 3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations. With service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers;Â and those that provide fraud detection services.Â With advertisers. Â Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address. Third-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically. Third-party collaborators. Depending on your settings , or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in Xâs Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.Â Through our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com . 3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest. We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to: comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request ; protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services; explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation ofÂ our Rules ); address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services. We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes. 3.4 With our Affiliates. We may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services. 3.5 As a result of a change in ownership. We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity. 4. How Long We Keep Information We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example: We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information. We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other usersâ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed. We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law. If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights. We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here . We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 12 months.Â We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 12 months. Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts. We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example: To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access here . In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters. Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims. To maintain the safety and security of our products and services. Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services. Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here . 5. Take Control 5.1 Access, Correction, Portability. You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings . You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here . You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here . To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity. 5.2 Deleting your Information. If you follow the instructions here , your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android.

You can manage your privacy settings and other account features here . If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings youâve adjusted.Â You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others. 5.4 Authorized Agent Requests. To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone elseâs information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification. 6. Your Rights and Ours We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements. 6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information. X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, weâd encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing . And no, we donât sell your personal information.Â 6.2 We move your data to make X work for you. Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience â itâs what you expect from us. We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us here . If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly. X is a participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us here . As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body JAMS , and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in Annex 1 Â to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK.

Â Before you scroll, read this Itâs really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail. With that in mind, weâve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how itâs used, and when itâs shared.Â So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this: Â X is a public platform Learn whatâs viewable & searchable We collect some data about you LearnÂ what we collect & how Affiliate services may have their own policies Learn about affiliates We use your data to make X better Learn how we make your info work You can control your experience Learn how to update your settings If you have questions about how we use data, just ask Learn how to contact us Privacy Policy 1.

General 10. How To Contact X 1. Information We Collect The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories. 1.1 Information you provide us. To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services. Personal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, âCreatorsâ); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.Â Professional Accounts. If you create a professional account , you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.Â Payment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. Preferences. Â When you set your preferences using yourÂ settings , we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences. Biometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes. Job Applications / Recommendations. Â We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the âInformation we collect when you use Xâ section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising. 1.2 Information we collect when you use X. When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you. Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including: Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts youâve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of. Your interactions with other usersâ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts youâve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting). How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related toÂ Encrypted Messages , and when you useÂ Direct Messages , including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.

Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including: Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information. Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level. Your device address book, if youâve chosen to share it with us. Location Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where youâve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account. Inferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below: When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiï¬ers). When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X. When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect. Log Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as: IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiï¬ers; and identiï¬ers associated with cookies.

Â Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. Â We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates , and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. 2. How We Use Information Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think itâs most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us . Here we go: 2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services. We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates , third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy. We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings , which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy. 2.2Â Foster safety and security. We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law. 2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better. We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better. 2.4 Communicate with you about our services. We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If youâre open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time. 2.5 Research. We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services. 3. Sharing Information You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information. 3.1 When you post and share. With the general public .Â You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings ). With other X users. Depending on your settings , and based on the X products and services you use, we share: Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow. Content you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages . Please keep in mind that if youâve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service. With partners. Â Depending on your settings , we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center . You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the âData sharing with business partnersâ option in your Privacy & Safety settings .Â (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.) 3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations. With service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers;Â and those that provide fraud detection services.Â With advertisers. Â Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP addr... [Content truncated]",success,50023,2025-07-18 12:27:09

We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads. We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined: Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn tag on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers; Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry); Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3; Information from advertising partners , vendors and publishers ; and Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member). Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our European Regional Privacy Notice . We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings , if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings can be found here . For Visitors, the setting is here . Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing We promote our Services to you and others. In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research We develop our Services and conduct research Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to researchers to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support We use data to help you and fix problems. We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You We use data to generate insights that do not identify you. We use your data to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations. We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Key Terms Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.

We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to ""unsubscribe"" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 5. Other Important Information 5.1. Security We monitor for and try to prevent security breaches. Please use the security features available through our Services. We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please visit our Safety Center for additional information about safely using our Services, including two-factor authentication . 5.2. Cross-Border Data Transfers We store and use your data outside your country.

Apple,https://apple.com,https://apple.com/privacy/,"Privacy. That’s Apple. Privacy. That’s Apple. Privacy is a fundamental human right. It’s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That’s the kind of innovation we believe in. Safari. A browser that’s actually private. Choose a browser that actually protects your privacy. Feature Safari Chrome Blocks third-party cookies from tracking you by default Yes No Fights tracking with machine learning Yes No Removes unique trackers from URLs in Private Browsing Yes No Hides your IP address from known trackers Yes No Prevents web extensions from seeing your browsing by default Yes No Blocks known trackers in Private Browsing Yes No Switch to Safari Apple Intelligence. Great powers come with great privacy. Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. * With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple. On-device processing allows Apple Intelligence to be aware of your data without collecting your data. On-device processing The cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on‑device processing, which gives Apple Intelligence the ability to fulfill many of your requests without leaving your device. Deeply integrated into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac Powered by Apple silicon Designed to protect your privacy at every step Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy of Apple devices for more complex requests. Private Cloud Compute The data required to fulfill your request is sent to Apple silicon servers — no other data is sent. Your request is processed — never stored or accessible to Apple. Your response is returned to you — and only you. Some requests require more computational power than what fits in your pocket. For these more complex requests, Apple Intelligence can draw on Private Cloud Compute and extend the privacy of your Apple devices to Apple silicon servers. And our privacy promise can be verified by independent experts. Learn more about Apple Intelligence Learn more about Apple Intelligence Our apps mind their business. Not yours. Safari throws trackers off your trail. Safari Some websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari toolbar. When you use Private Browsing, the details of your browsing aren’t saved, and the websites you visit aren’t shared with your other Apple devices. And starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Private Browsing locks your private browsing windows when you’re not using them, completely blocks known trackers from loading on pages, and removes tracking added to URLs as you browse. View all privacy features Health keeps your records under wraps. Health From your heart rate to your menstrual cycle, apps and devices for your health can give you insight into some of your most personal details. With the Health app, you’re in charge of what information you’d like to include, what not to, and who has access to it. When you do want to securely share your health data from the Health app with your doctors, they’ll see the data you shared in a dashboard in the provider’s health records system. All of your data is encrypted and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. So however you use the Health app, you’re always in control of your data. Wallet and Apple Pay help hide what you buy. Wallet and Apple Pay When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants. When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes. Maps makes your location history, history. Maps Where you go says a lot about you. Maps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. And because Maps doesn’t include a sign-in, where you go isn’t associated with your Apple Account at all. Many personalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly changing. Photos lets you choose who has the full picture. Photos Your photo and video albums are full of precious moments, friends, and your favorite things. Apple devices are designed to give you control over those memories. Photos is also designed so that the face recognition and scene and object detection — which power features like For You, Memories, Sharing Suggestions, and the People album — happen on device instead of in the cloud. In fact, the A13 Bionic and later chips perform over 100 billion operations per photo to recognize faces and places without ever leaving your device. And when apps request access to your photos, you can share just the images you want — not your entire library. Messages are only seen by who you send them to. Messages From inside jokes to invitations, a lot of life happens in text and video chats. Every blue-bubble message, picture, Animoji, and video is encrypted while being sent between devices. Smart suggestions in Messages, like pulling up photos to send based on who you’re messaging, are all done on your device. Siri learns what you need. Not who you are. Siri Siri was designed from the beginning to learn your preferences without sharing your identity with Apple or anyone else. You don’t sign in with your Apple Account to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your device thanks to the power of the Apple Neural Engine. When Apple does process or store data on our servers, it’s associated with a random identifier — a long string of letters and numbers. That data is used only to improve Siri, and we never share or sell it. Apple doesn’t retain audio of your requests unless you choose to share it with us to improve Siri. Apple News leaves what you read off the record. Apple News Many news sources keep track of your identity and create a profile of you. Apple News delivers personalized content without knowing who you are. The content you read is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple Account. You get editor-curated content and a personalized newsfeed so you can stay up to date with the latest news and stories. And because Apple News uses machine learning, the more you use it, the better your app gets to know what you like — without Apple ever knowing what you’re into. App Store shows you what’s in store for your data. App Store Every one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at Apple. When you’re checking out an app, you’ll see its Privacy Nutrition Label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location — and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or data brokers. Discover everyday privacy protections. Private Browsing. Powerfully private. Private Browsing When you turn on Private Browsing, Safari won’t save the sites you visit, your searches, or any information from forms you fill out. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections help prevent websites from tracking or identifying your device. And your private browsing windows automatically lock when you’re not using them. Locked and Hidden Apps. Choose what’s visible. Locked and Hidden Apps Locked apps allow you to show your screen to someone while protecting sensitive areas of your phone. For additional privacy, you can hide a locked app. This removes the hidden app’s name and icon from the Home Screen and search results, and pauses its notifications. You can access locked or hidden apps with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Passkeys. Simple. Secure. So not a password . Passkeys A passkey eliminates the need for a password by using a unique digital key that only works from the site or app it was created for, so you don’t have to worry about website leaks or phishing. Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices. Just use Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate and you’re done. Lock Hidden Albums. Keep Hidden and Recently Deleted photos private. Lock Hidden Albums Your Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos are locked by default and can be unlocked using your device’s authentication method — Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode. Safety Check. Take control in times of crisis. Safety Check Safety Check is a section in Settings that helps people in domestic or intimate partner violence situations quickly reset the access they’ve granted to others.

Section D: Cookies and other Technologies We, our Service Providers, Netflix Marketing Providers, and Advertising Companies use cookies, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags), hashed identifiers, and resettable device identifiers for various reasons.

To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below “ How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies? ” Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, Hashed Identifiers, and Resettable Device Identifiers Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies. We may also create, use, and disclose hashed identifiers. As described above, hashing is a process of converting the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information. If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Why Does Netflix Use These Technologies? We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to support Advertisements; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce the Netflix Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites. We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our service. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened. Netflix uses hashed identifiers and resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, to support Advertisements (including delivering Advertisements to you), and for analytics and optimization purposes. To learn more about the types of cookies used by Netflix, please click here . How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?

To exercise choice regarding other similar technologies In addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.

Where appropriate, we also rely on other transfer mechanisms such as data processing agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission or the United Kingdom.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

We collect: Identity Data We collect information such as your username, password, email address, IP address (collected at each site visit). This information is also used to identify individual users to the Public Network and to award activities and attribute them to you. Your username and additional content you provide, including your profile picture, question and answer content, and your reputation, are visible publicly. We or our community moderators may delete a question, an answer, a comment, or all of them and after deletion such information is only available to certain community members or Stack employees.

Account registration information When you register for a Stack Overflow account, we collect your name and email address, your username and any additional information you provide. We will generate a unique identification number that we will use to recognize you when you are signed in. We need to collect your personal information for account registration purposes. Although the Network provides for anonymous and pseudonymous participation, in some instances in order to use certain Products or Services, we require account registration. This requires a name associated with your account, an email address at which we can contact you, and in some cases, additional information, including a contact address, a billing address, and a password to help secure your personal information. Billing information For Products and Services requiring payment, we collect a billing name, phone number, and email address. We also collect a billing and shipping address for invoicing purposes.

If you are using the private Network (e.g., Stack Overflow for Teams), your account settings, including name, affiliated role and company, and other information may be shared with your private Network Team members designated as authorized users of your private Network account. While some of the public and private Network profile information is required, much of it is within your control as we describe herein and can be modified, updated, and restricted by you in your settings. Information we use to identify and authenticate you We need this information to be able to recognize you, for example, when you access your accounts. It also helps us to protect your details and keep them secure. We may also use this information for fraud detection and prevention. Analytics information Stack Overflow uses data analytics to ensure site functionality and to optimize our Product and Service offerings to you.

Please be aware that when using the Public Question and Answer Network, you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish and to allow others to have derivative rights to such public content once it is made public. The content you contribute on the public network is public, in perpetuity, and Stack Overflow loses direct control over such content when it is published on the open internet.

However, we can work with users to remove any personal data that has been posted in error or which a user wishes to remove. Additionally, from time to time, Stack Overflow makes such public content available via our Stack Overflow Network API, compilation via the Creative Commons Data Dump and by providing public content to the Stack Overflow Network. You should be aware that such content, once public, cannot often be removed from public view even if it is removed from the Stack Overflow network and our servers.

A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognize and remember you. We may place cookies on your device (with your consent, where applicable), as well as partner with third parties, including advertising partners, who may use cookies or other similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. Please see our cookie policy for additional information on how we use cookies and what third party cookies we permit. Tracking Stack Overflow emails use Javascript for email tracking of opens, clicks, and unsubscribes or may contain a small, invisible, one pixel image which can be used to let us know when the email is opened or forwarded. If the email recipient has images enabled on their device, when the email is opened, a message (an automatic request) is sent to Stack Overflow’s server requesting the image. That request is logged by Stack Overflow and tells us that the email has been opened. A similar process may be used in relation to links or attachments in the email, with a request being sent to Stack Overflow for the content that is accessible via the links or attachments, thus telling Stack Overflow that the link or attachment has been accessed. Developer Survey As the world’s largest developer community, Stack Overflow publishes an annual Developer Survey to provide key insights into the developer community, as well as other surveys from time to time, some of which include demographic (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.) and certain personal information. Your participation in the Developer Survey as well as any other Stack Overflow survey is entirely voluntary. In order to provide meaningful insights into the developer community, Stack Overflow may collect sensitive data about you, including, but not limited to your gender, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and your location. We consider this data to be among our most sensitive and have taken elevated measures to protect such data as well as to de-identify your name and other personal information from such data. We restrict such data within Stack Overflow on a privileged basis to only those that need to see it and while we may share your personal information with our third party providers for our research, we do so only after imposing contractual obligations of confidentiality on such third parties and only where necessary for limited research purposes. When we publish our surveys, they are published as a compilation of anonymized data. We may ask for your consent to contact you following completion of the surveys. If you have any questions concerning the Developer Survey or other survey and our security measures to protect your sensitive personal data, please contact us at: [email protected] . Advertising on our Network We work with third party advertisers to deliver ads on our Network. This involves tracking, targeting and measuring, using your personal data. We will get consent through our online consent management portal, or via other consent mechanisms before we can use your personal data in this way. Targeting: Advertisers can target their campaigns using topic tags. Advertisers can target by geography, which is identified through Google Ad Manager, based on a visitor’s IP address (which is truncated by Google). Advertisers can target by industry or company size, which is identified using IP address and matching that to Dunn & Bradstreet data. Measuring: We allow advertisers to use MOAT, Doubleverify, and IAS tags on their campaigns to monitor for fraud. We also offer conversion pixels so advertisers can track conversions that happen within 30 days of an ad being served.

Bbc,https://bbc.com,https://bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jmledvr3o,"Meta investors settle $8bn lawsuit with Zuckerberg over Facebook privacy 10 hours ago Share Save Nadine Yousif BBC News Lily Jamali North America Technology Correspondent Share Save Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to settle a multibillion dollar lawsuit with a group of shareholders over how top executives and directors at Meta handled repeated privacy violations by Facebook. The shareholders were seeking $8bn (£6bn) in damages. It is unclear how much they agreed to settle for. The settlement was announced on Thursday by a lawyer for the shareholders, just before the trial was about to enter its second day in a Delaware court. Meta declined to comment on the settlement. The Meta shareholders had alleged that Mr Zuckerberg's actions led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which the data of millions of Facebook users was leaked and used by a political consulting firm. The shareholders had asked the judge to order the 11 defendants named in the case to reimburse Meta for more than $8bn in fines and legal costs, which they say the company has had to pay in order to resolve claims of users' privacy breaches. The shareholders also questioned the timing of share sales by top brass at the company. Meta was formerly known as Facebook, and is the parent company of the social media platform, along with photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp. The shareholder lawsuit was filed in 2018, after it was revealed that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. Among the defendants was Jeffrey Zients, who served as Meta director for two years starting in May 2018, and was also former President Joe Biden's White House chief of staff. In testimony on Wednesday, Mr Zients acknowledged that a $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine was substantial, but said that the company did not agree to pay it to protect Mr Zuckerberg from legal liability. Other defendants included Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir Technologies, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The settlement allows the defendants to avoid testifying under oath. Former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had also been slated to testify. ""One thing that could have come out of a full trial is a full accounting of how Facebook came to adopt and approve any illegal practices,"" said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. ""It's valuable for society to know how this happened and what went wrong that they were breaking the law, if they were breaking the law,"" Lipton added. ""That kind of exposure serves a valuable social purpose. We won't get that accounting now."" Meta was not a direct party to the lawsuit but has said that its has invested billions of dollars in privacy reforms since 2019. Prior to the settlement, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, a Delaware judge, was set to hear testimony through next week before rendering a decision. Last year, Ms McCormick drew the ire of Tesla boss Elon Musk after she rejected his $56 billion pay package. The electric vehicle-maker has left Delaware and reincorporated in Texas.

Cnn,https://cnn.com,https://cnn.com/2025/07/16/tech/facebook-privacy-practices-trial-zuckerberg,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech during the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California on September 25, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters CNN — An $8 billion trial by Meta Platforms shareholders against Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former company leaders kicks off on Wednesday over claims that they illegally harvested the data of Facebook users in violation of a 2012 agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission. Jeffrey Zients, White House chief of staff under President Joe Biden and a Meta director for two years starting in May 2018, is expected to be one of the first witnesses to take the stand in the non-jury trial before Kathaleen McCormick, chief judge of the Delaware Chancery Court. The case will feature testimony from Zuckerberg and other billionaire defendants including former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, venture capitalist and board member Marc Andreessen and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. A lawyer for the defendants, who have denied the allegations, declined to comment. The case began in 2018, following revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica , a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s successful US presidential campaign in 2016. The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, saying the company had violated a 2012 agreement with the FTC to protect user data. Shareholders want the defendants to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine and other legal costs, which the plaintiffs estimate total more than $8 billion. In court filings, the defendants described the allegations as “extreme” and said the evidence at trial will show Facebook hired an outside consulting firm to ensure compliance with the FTC agreement and that Facebook was a victim of Cambridge Analytica’s deceit. Meta, which is not a defendant, declined to comment. On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019. The lawsuit is considered the first of its kind to go to trial that alleges board members consciously failed to oversee their company. This is often described as the hardest claim to prove in Delaware corporate law. Boeing’s current and former board members settled a case with similar claims in 2021 for $237.5 million, the largest ever in an alleged breach of oversight lawsuit. The Boeing directors did not admit to wrongdoing. In addition to privacy claims at the heart of the Meta case, plaintiffs allege that Zuckerberg anticipated that the Cambridge Analytica scandal would send the company’s stock lower and sold his Facebook shares as a result, pocketing at least $1 billion. Defendants said evidence will show that Zuckerberg did not trade on inside information and that he used a stock-trading plan that removes his control over sales and is designed to guard against insider trading. McCormick is expected to rule on liability and damages months after the trial concludes.",success,3119,2025-07-18 12:27:09

We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you. Copyright We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our Copyright Policy . We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Copyright infringement claims should be submitted using our Copyright Complaint Form or submitted to our designated agent for our Services at: Copyright Agent Dropbox, Inc. 1800 Owens St San Francisco, CA 94158 copyright@dropbox.com Paid Accounts Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a “Paid Account”). We’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws. Cancellation. You may cancel your Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law . For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions and obtain a refund within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account by clicking here . Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you’re on a Dropbox Family plan, the Family manager may be able to downgrade your account at any time. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features. Changes. We may change the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our product offerings, changes to our business, or changes in economic conditions. We’ll give you no less than 30 days’ advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect. Dropbox Teams Email address. If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Team or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address. Using Dropbox Teams. If you join a Dropbox Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox Team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox Team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Team. Termination You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if Dropbox reasonably believes: you’re in breach of these Terms, your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or you don’t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services. We won’t provide notice or an opportunity to export Your Stuff before termination or suspension of access to the Services where Dropbox reasonably believes: you’re in material breach of these Terms, which includes, but is not limited to, violating our Acceptable Use Policy , doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or we're prohibited from doing so by law. Once we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, you will not be able to access or export Your Stuff. Dropbox does not provide refunds if we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, unless required by law. Discontinuation of Services We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to exceptional unforeseen circumstances, events beyond Dropbox’s control (for example a natural disaster, fire, or explosion), or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems (we will give you no less than 30 days’ notice where possible under the circumstances). If we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for. Services “AS IS” We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ""AS IS."" WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. For example, these disclaimers do not override the legal protections, including statutory warranties, granted to consumers by EU law. Limitation of Liability WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE AN EU OR UK CONSUMER, THESE TERMS DO NOT EXCLUDE DROPBOX’S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR OF OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU, AS LONG AS THOSE LOSSES AND DAMAGES ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR: ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY. THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES. OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW . Resolving Disputes Let’s Try to Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written Notice of Dispute at dispute-notice@dropbox.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days after submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr . Judicial Forum for Disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements. The venue and exclusive jurisdiction provision above does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates. IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS: We Both Agree to Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the Services through final and binding individual arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under the “Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its scope, enforceability, revocability, or validity. The arbitrator may award relief only individually and only to the extent necessary to redress your individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the general public. Opt out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account or agreeing to these Terms. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding. Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA’s rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. For North Carolina consumers, for claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates, the arbitration will be held in North Carolina or any other location we agree to. Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. For individual arbitration of non-frivolous claims less than $75,000 for which you timely provided Dropbox with a Notice of Dispute, Dropbox will reimburse arbitration filing fees at the conclusion of the arbitration and will pay other arbitration fees. For all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim. This exclusive jurisdiction provision does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS . You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed. Severability . If any part of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public injunctive relief, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration. Controlling Law These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws. Entire Agreement These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute with you. Otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties. Waiver, Severability & Assignment Dropbox’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Modifications We may revise these Terms to better reflect: changes to the law, new regulatory requirements, or improvements or enhancements made to our Services. If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you. If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account and stop using the Services before the updated Terms become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.",success,25223,2025-07-18 12:27:09

Shopify,https://shopify.com,https://shopify.com/legal/privacy,"Updated March 2, 2023 Privacy Policy How Shopify handles your data We're updating our Privacy Policy, effective July 25, 2025. Click here to review the changes Introduction In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our merchants using Shopify to power your business customers who shop at a Shopify-powered business partners who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business users of Shopify apps and services like Shop or Shop Pay visitors to Shopify’s websites , or anyone contacting Shopify support This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email). Our values Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy. Your information belongs to you We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit. We protect your information from others If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden. We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive. Why we process your information We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include: preventing risk and fraud answering questions or providing other types of support helping merchants find and use apps through our app store providing and improving our products and services providing reporting and analytics testing out features or additional services assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information. We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us. Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data. Your rights over your information We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information. We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights. Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law. If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are a processor and process information on their behalf. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions. If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our online portal . Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents. Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”. If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time. Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a “Do Not Track” signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way. Where we send your information We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders. Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant. Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we do so in accordance with applicable law. If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our Subprocessors ), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests . How long do we retain your information We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format. Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information. Our use of Machine Learning One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws, including certain EEA and UK laws, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store). How we protect your information Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at /in/security . How we use “cookies” and other tracking technologies We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services. For more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant’s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy . How you can reach us If you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, please contact Shopify Support , or mail us at one of the addresses below. If you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else’s personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests . If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with and you are located in the EEA or UK, Shopify International Ltd is the controller of your personal data. If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store, the merchant is your data controller and we are acting as a processor on their behalf. If you have questions about how a merchant or store processes your personal information, you should contact the merchant or visit their privacy policy. Shopify Commerce Singapore Pte. Ltd.

We collect account and payment information you provide to us (including information about your business if you are a merchant), Shopify stores or items you save to favorites, purchases you make, reviews you post, and how you otherwise interact or communicate with stores or other users on our apps or services. We also collect information about how you browse through our apps and sites, including search terms you may enter. Your device(s): We collect information from and about the devices you use, including computers, phones, and other web-connected devices you use to access our apps or services, and we combine this information across different devices you use. Third parties: We receive information from partners who help us provide you with our services including the following: Email providers. If you use the Shop App and you connect your third party inboxes, such as Gmail or Outlook (according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law), we receive information to identify shopping-related emails and display within Shop information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information. Service Providers. We receive information from our service providers, who help us provide services to our merchants, like reviewing accounts for fraud or other concerns. Marketplaces. If you use the Shop App, we receive information about purchases you have made from other marketplaces or platforms, such as Amazon, that you choose to connect through Shop.

How long we keep your information Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information, including sensitive personal information, while you use Shopify products or services or until you tell us to delete your information. We may also keep personal information to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. If you are a merchant operating a Shopify-powered store, and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the deletion process. When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant, and the merchant, not Shopify, decides how long your information is retained. Your rights over your information Depending on where you live, how you use Shopify, and subject to certain exceptions, you may have some or all of the following rights: Right to Know: The right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, and information about our data practices. Right to Request Correction: The right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you. Right to Request Deletion: The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you. To exercise your rights, including the “right to know” and “right to delete,” please submit a request through our online portal.

Under US Privacy Laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information.

We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Coursera, Inc. (referred to as ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our""), believes in protecting your privacy. This DPF Notice contains supplementary information relating to Personal Data transferred on the basis of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. This DPF Notice should be read in conjunction with Courseraâs Privacy Notice , which provides details of the Personal Data processed, purposes for which Personal Data is collected, processed and disclosed, types of third parties to which Personal Data is disclosed, and rights of individuals. To the extent of any conflict between this DPF Notice and Courseraâs Privacy Notice, this DPF Notice prevails. We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (together the âDPFâ) which includes the DPF Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability (the ""Principles"") for transfers of Personal Data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland, respectively, to the U.S. To learn more about the DPF, please visit the DPF website: https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov . For more information regarding our DPF certification, please click here or search for âCourseraâ in the DPF list of participants. Your Choices We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Data (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Data) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than an agent performing tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of Coursera) ); or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Notice), or subsequently authorized by you, when the circumstances arise.

We encourage interested persons to first contact us (contact information provided below) and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the Principles. If your enquiry is not satisfactorily addressed by us, we have registered with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (""ICDR""), a division of the American Arbitration Association, to provide independent third party dispute resolution (free of charge) to you.

For residents of the United Kingdom, the Information Commissionerâs Office will serve this role. In the context of an onward transfer, Coursera has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Coursera shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Coursera proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Jurisdiction As part of our participation in DPF, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.

By interacting with Target through our stores, websites, mobile application(s), products, services, or otherwise, you consent to the use of information that is collected or submitted as described in this privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically. 1) Categories of Information Collected 2) How is Your Information Collected? 3) How is Your Information Used? 4) How is Your Information Shared? 5) What Choices Do You Have? 6) Loyalty & Financial Incentive Program 7) State-Specific Privacy Information 8) How do You Access and Update Your Personal Information? 9) How is Your Personal Information Protected? 10) How is Your Personal Information Retained? 11) Automated License Plate Recognition Technology 12) How do you contact Target? 13) Target Privacy Policy Scope 1. Categories of information Collected: The following categories of information may be collected when interacting with Target: Identifiers (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number, payment information, driver’s license number, license plate number, device ID, IP address, online identifiers) Demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, date of birth, education, occupation, physical characteristics) Commercial information (e.g., products or services purchased, registry or list information) Internet or other electronic network activity (e.g., browse or search history, device information, online interactions with websites, mobile applications, electronic communications, and advertisements) Geolocation data (e.g., latitude or longitude, in-store location) Health data (e.g., in connection with Guest service or product development) Sensory information (e.g., audio, visual, or similar information such as photographs, Guest service calls recordings, video recordings) Inferences drawn from any of the above (e.g., preferences or characteristics) Depending on applicable laws, some information within the categories above may be considered sensitive personal information, including government identifiers, payment information, race, precise geolocation data, and health data. If required, consent will be obtained before collecting sensitive personal information (e.g., before the mobile application uses precise geolocation to enable features like drive-up services and in-store maps). If you choose not to provide information, we may not be able to provide you with requested products, services or information. Back to top 2. How Is Your Information Collected? You Provide It to Us We collect information that you enter on our digital properties or give to us in other ways (e.g., when you contact Guest Relations, order on Target.com, purchase a product in a Target store or create a gift registry). Automated Information Collection We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target Guest. If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc. In order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how our marketing efforts are performing and how you are interacting on our website, in our stores, on our mobile application(s), and with our advertisements and emails. Third-party Automated Collection We and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services. We also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process. The tags may collect information from your interactions on Target.com. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party companies. Please contact these third-party companies (e.g., Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags. Social Media Widgets Our sites and mobile application(s) include social media features, such as the Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third-party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. Mobile Location Information If you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile application(s), services or our service providers. For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores; or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more. To manage how you share your device’s location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy. Cameras We use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security. When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., see item in your space) or virtual try on services (e.g., try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from your device’s camera for these services is used in real time and is not stored on the servers. The virtual try on experience operates within your own device or browser and the data is deleted after the experience ends. Information From Other Sources We collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing Guest information and improve the accuracy of our records. This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing. Back to Top 3. How Is Your Information Used? Information we collect is used for a variety of purposes, including activities such as: processing transactions, helping our Guest Relations representatives resolve issues, identifying fraud and improving our services. In addition, information we collect improves your experience by delivering more personalized interactions and advertising in digital (e.g., Target.com, mobile app, other online sites) and social media (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest), as well as TV and Video platforms. We also use information we collect for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores and on our mobile application(s), the performance of our marketing efforts and your response to those marketing efforts. Our Purposes (including but not limited to marketing) Deliver coupons, mobile offers newsletters, in-store receipt messages, emails, mobile messages, targeted advertising and social media notifications Provide interactive features of the website or mobile application(s), such as product reviews or Weekly Ad, send marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions Administer promotions, surveys, focus groups, and loyalty and subscription programs Cross-context and cross-device linking Interest-based advertising Improve Guest experiences Conduct research and analysis Personalize content, including using your image Perform other business activities as needed, or as described elsewhere in this policy Product and Service Fulfillment Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, deliveries, payments, and returns/exchanges Respond to requests for information about our products and services in our stores, on our websites or mobile application(s) or to otherwise serve you Connect with you regarding Guest service via our contact center, Guest service desk, or on social media or internet chat platforms. Chat functionality allows our Guest Relations specialists to see what a Guest is typing before hitting the send button. This allows for quicker response time as our specialists anticipate questions. Provide services such as gift registry or a shopping list Award and fulfill benefits associated with use of our services Administer sweepstakes and contests Conduct a transaction where we collect information required by law (for example, pseudoephedrine or age-restricted purchases) Allow you to, using our mobile application(s): find a store nearest to your location, show you a map of the store (if available), use our drive up capabilities (where available), add and redeem offers, search for products and check availability, check prices, provide product ratings and reviews, track your orders, scan a UPC barcode or QR code, use voice recognition to add to your list, update information, etc Cross-Context We merge data collected from our own websites and mobile application(s). Examples of the data collected include: cookie IDs, device advertising IDs, transaction and browsing history, your interaction with our online and mobile advertisements, including advertisements we serve within our emails and advertisements that we serve on behalf of third parties through Roundel, Target’s in-house media company; information about ads we serve, such as which ad was served, your interactions with the ads, and the URLs where the ads are served by marketing partners such as Google. For mobile platforms that require opt-in consent to link or track user or device data, unless you consent, Target does not link or track user or device data collected from Target application(s) with user or device data collected from other companies’ applications, websites or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. If a guest provides opt-in consent to the linking and use of data with a specifically identified third party partner, such data may be linked and may be used by Target and/or the third party partner as described at the time consent is obtained, including for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Cross-Device Linking We may also link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in a relevant experience on another device. This allows us to deliver more personalized and consistent advertising to you. For example, if you purchase a product on our website using your desktop, we are able to avoid showing you an advertisement on the same product on your mobile phone; if you add an item to your cart on Target.com through your mobile device, but leave Target.com without purchasing the item, we are able to show you that item in your cart on another device. Interest-Based Advertising We participate in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile application(s). This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies use non-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information.

If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features. To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on. Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third-party. Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or application(s), or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target. To opt-out of our interest-based advertising for Target’s goods and services or those of another party, online and in third-party mobile applications, visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page here and perform a global opt-out. Options you select are browser and device specific. To learn more about interest-Based Advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website .

If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again. Do Not Track Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals. However, Target treats Global Privacy Control signals as opt-out of sale and opt out of targeted/cross-context behavioral advertising requests under applicable state laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act).

Wordpress,https://wordpress.com,https://automattic.com/privacy/,"Privacy Policy Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles: We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services. We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it. We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted. We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information. We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information. Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles. Who We Are and What This Policy Covers Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use: Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, atavist.com, mailpoet.com, automatewoo.com, jetpackcrm.com, happy.tools, wpcourses.com, wpscan.com, newspack.pub, and wp.cloud); Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS); Our other Automattic products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites (for example, WordPress.com plans, the Payments feature, the Pay with PayPal block, WordPress.com, Jetpack, Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, MailPoet, AutomateWoo, Jetpack CRM, Happy Tools, WordPress.com Courses, WPScan and Newspack); and Other users’ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us. This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Automattic or one of our subsidiaries. Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” And if you’d like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies . Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like Tumblr, that have a separate privacy policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information. Creative Commons Sharealike License We’ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on GitHub . You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site. Information We Collect We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect. Information You Provide to Us It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples: Basic account information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create a WordPress.com account. Public profile information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include. Payment and contact information: There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us — a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a custom domain , some Longreads swag — or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. If you use our Ecommerce Services (including Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, and WooPayments), you’ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information. Additionally, if you use WooPay to make purchases on other sites, we will store the contact information and payment information you provide to that service. And if you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like WordAds , you’ll provide some additional information — for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you. Business Profile: Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. For example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us. If you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service’s features. Content information: You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload). Credentials: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly. Communications with us (hi there!): You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law). Job applicant information: If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, professional or personal references, similar professional and employment-related data, and work authorization verification as part of the application process. We may also collect additional information about you during the process, like background and credit checks (in applicable jurisdictions and only for certain job roles). You may also provide us with demographic information when required by law or to support our diverse workplace initiatives, such as your gender, racial or ethnic origin, veteran status, and disability status if you voluntarily submit such information as part of your application. We collect demographic information in accordance with applicable law, and do not request demographic information in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited. We will only use this sensitive information to accommodate a disability or illness, comply with legal obligations, protect the health and safety of our employees, and facilitate our internal programs relating to diversity, inclusion, and anti-discrimination. Information We Collect Automatically We also collect some information automatically: Log information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com. Transactional information: When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. This includes when you purchase something we sell or when you use our Services (like WooPay ) to buy something from a third party. Usage information: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). Our WooCommerce Usage Tracker also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention. Location information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions. Stored information: We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website. Interactions with other users’ sites: We collect some information about your interactions with other users’ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you. As another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile. Information from cookies & other technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy . Information We Collect from Other Sources We may also get information about you from other sources. For example: Third Party Login: If you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address) Social Sharing Services: If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature , we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service. Financial Account Info : If you use WooPayments, we’ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number. If you use WooPay, we’ll receive your payment information from Stripe. Google Account Information: When you connect your Google account to your Newspack powered site, we may access certain Google user data such as your Google Ad Manager Configuration (the network code and your ad units) and your Google Analytics data to allow you to access and manage features more seamlessly. For example, you may be able to manage your Google ads and see your Google Analytics data directly within the dashboard of your Newspack powered site. The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available. Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services. How and Why We Use Information Purposes for Using Information We use information about you for the purposes listed below: To provide our Services. For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information. To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services. For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use. To place and manage ads in our advertising program. For example, to place ads on our users’ sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance. To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing. For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention. To protect our Services, our users, and the public. For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services. To fix problems with our Services. For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues. To customize the user experience. For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure. To communicate with you. For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.) To recruit and hire new Automatticians. For example, by evaluating job applicants (including verifying their identity, experience, and other information submitted) and communicating with them by phone, email, or social media platforms. If the application progresses, we may also collect interview information and background check information. This may also include verifying information required to initiate employment, for purposes such as confirming ability to legally work in a specific location, setting up payroll, and complying with statutory reporting requirements. Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy . Sharing Information How We Share Information We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others : Subsidiaries and independent contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them. Third-party vendors: We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooPayments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on woocommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our Cookie Policy ). Legal and regulatory requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines . Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers’ (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document for more details. To protect rights, property, and others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay . Business transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy. With your consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature. Aggregated or de-identified information: We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms. Site owners: If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment. Or if you make a payment (like via the Payments feature ) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site. Or if you follow/subscribe to another WordPress.com site we will share your email address with the site owner. Published support requests: If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users. Information Shared Publicly Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your “Likes” and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views! For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven’t uploaded one, is your G lobally R ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar — get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and “Likes” that you make on other users’ websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, “Likes,” and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website. We also provide a “Firehose” stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Find out more about opting out of the Firehose for WordPress.com and Jetpack sites. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly. How Long We Keep Information We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic’s websites, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites. As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged. If you are a job applicant, we will keep your personal data during the application process, and for a certain period thereafter. To determine that period, we take into account a number of factors, like our legal and regulatory obligations (such as equal opportunity obligations) and whether we may need to retain personal data for internal business purposes like analyzing our applicant pool. Security While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication . Choices You have several choices available when it comes to information about you: Limit the information that you provide: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge — may not be accessible. If you are a job applicant, and you choose not to provide certain data elements to us, we may not be able to proceed with the recruitment process. Limit access to information on your mobile device: Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs. Opt out of marketing communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices. Set your browser to reject cookies: At this time, Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Opt out of our internal analytics program: You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you’re logged in to your WordPress.com account. For more information, please see our Cookie Policy . Close your account: While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. ( Here are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests. Your Rights If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data. European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to: Request access to your personal data; Request correction or deletion of your personal data; Object to our use and processing of your personal data; Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and Request portability of your personal data. You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority. US Privacy Laws Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You’ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law). In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used: Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers); Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example); Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status as part of your job application); Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site); Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address); Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one); Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition). If you are a job applicant, we may have also collected: Education information, such as the education you disclose in your job application. You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section . And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section . We retain this information for the length of time described in our How Long We Keep Information section . In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state’s respective law, including the right to: Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you’re in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with; Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain; Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain; Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information; Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights. You can find detailed metrics about Automattic’s compliance with these rights in our Privacy Report . Right to Opt Out We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a “sale” or “share” in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of. You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states. Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you’ll need to make this selection again. We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out. We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don’t knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16. Your Information & Personalized Advertising Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users’ sites and some of our own. The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” or “share” of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to Advertising on WordPress.com Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program . Contacting Us About These Rights You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “ How to Reach Us ” to, well, find out how to reach us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us. Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information. In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing. Please note that the appeal process does not apply to job applicants. If your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.

Third-Party Software and Services If you’d like to use third-party plugins or embeds, WooPayments (powered by Stripe), Woo extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.

More About Location Information The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services. Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information – If you are accessing the Services through the Sites, including via your mobile web browser, we may detect your general location based on your device’s IP address information, so that we can automatically show you weather information, news stories, product updates, and special offers for your approximate area. Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If you allow collection on the Sites when accessing via your mobile web browser, your location may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or if your browser blocks the collection by default, then only your general location information is collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you searched (i.e., “contextual location”). Apps Use of Location Information - If you access the Services on your mobile device or automotive infotainment system and consent to sharing location information with our App, we may collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via GPS, cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter or information about the vehicle. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow any of our mobile or in-vehicle Apps to directly collect location information while the App is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your settings or by deleting the App. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive select alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for the Apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services, (last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection. Data Vendor Use of Location Information - Our service providers, and Advertising Vendors and Analytics Vendors (see Section 2 for more information) may also collect location information through the Services. We may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in Section 3 . Refer to The Weather Channel In-Vehicle Application Section 17 for more information about vendor use of location data for the in-vehicle app. Information from Advertisers, Analytics Vendors , and Advertising Vendors We may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from advertisers, Analytics Vendors, and Advertising Vendors (see Section 2 for more information).

We work with a variety of advertising services that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) on our behalf or on behalf of advertisers ( ”Advertising Vendors” ) in order to serve relevant ads. Advertising Vendors use various technologies on the Services to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what websites or apps users interact with after they leave the Services; link users' devices (i.e., cross-device or cross-platform tracking); and serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or apps that you visit. Advertising Vendors may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. More information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (“personalized advertising”) is available from the Network Advertising Initiative's website - https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/ . We also work with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about use of the Services and to analyze and optimize performance of the Services ( “Analytics Vendors” ). Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data.

They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests. Category 5: Social Network Cookies These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments. Web beacons: Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party. Web Storage: We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device. Use of Advertising Identifiers We and our Advertising Vendors may collect information about usage of the mobile apps via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising. An advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device. Advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number. Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Vendors You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways: Vendors : This Policy does not cover the practices of vendors outside of our Services and we do not control vendors’ technologies.

Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services. Do Not Track : Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and in general the signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance. As a result, we will not recognize requests coming through as DNT signals. Alerts and Notifications : Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications or in-vehicle app notifications for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers.

Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.

You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them. Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins, and Links Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by this Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.

We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any). Advertising Vendors We may share information we collect with Advertising Vendors , including those used by our advertisers, so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our Sites or Apps, advertisers’ websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps; (ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with, and; (iii) improve their services.

Depending on the nature of the trip reservation, we may also need to ask for your home address, phone number, payment info, date of birth, current location (in the case of on-demand services), whether you’re traveling for work purposes, the names and dates of birth of the people traveling with you, and any preferences you might have for your trip (e.g. dietary or accessibility requirements). For reservations for flights and certain attractions, we may be required to ask you for additional information including your and your co-travelers’ passport or national ID information. This may also be necessary for online check-in. When you contact our customer service team, contact your trip provider through our platform or reach out to us in a different way (e.g. through social media), we also collect information from you via these channels including metadata such as for calls, who you are, where you called from, and the date and length of the call. When you search using our platform for possible trip reservations, you can select to save specific trip items in a list that we’ll store for you. During or after your trip, we may also invite you to submit reviews that can inform others about the experiences you had on your trip. When you submit reviews on the platform, we collect information you’ve included along with your first name or display name and avatar (if you choose one). If you create a user account on our platform, we also store information you include and manage in that user account. This can include personal settings, credit card information, uploaded photos, and your reviews. You can also choose to add to your user account details from one or more of your identification documents so you don't have to re-enter this information for future trip reservations. The data kept in your user account can help you plan and manage future trip reservations and personalized recommendations. There are other circumstances where you’ll provide us with personal data. For example, if you’re using our platform from your mobile device, you can decide to allow Booking.com to use your current location or grant us access to some other details. This helps us give you the best possible service and experience by, for example, suggesting the nearest restaurants or attractions to your location or making other recommendations. Personal data you give us about others It may be that you use our platform to make a trip reservation on behalf of, or that involves, other travelers. In this case, you may be required to provide some details about these persons as part of the trip reservation. If you have a Booking.com for Business account, you can keep an address book there to make it easier to plan and manage business travel arrangements for others. In some cases, you might use Booking.com to share information with others. This can take the form of sharing a list of saved items for example. When you use the platform to share information about others, it’s your responsibility to ensure that each person you provide personal data about is aware that you’re doing so and understands how Booking.com uses their personal data (as described in this privacy statement). Personal data we collect automatically Whether or not you make a trip reservation, when you use our websites or mobile apps, we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the dates and times of using our platform and selected information about your device’s hardware and software (e.g. operating system, internet browser, mobile app version, language settings). When you are redirected by a third-party website or mobile app to a Booking.com website or mobile app, we collect this as well. We also collect information about clicks you make and which pages are shown to you from our platform, for example, via the cookies we drop. When you use our mobile apps, we collect data that identifies the mobile device as well as data about the operation (including possible crashes) of the app on that device. Personal data we receive from other sources We may also receive information about you from other sources. This can include one or more of the following: Other BHI companies Trip providers, for example as part of their interactions with our customer services Strategic partners we contract with Other third-party companies such as marketing partners Information we receive from these parties may be used together with information you provide us with directly via our platform for the purposes of providing services to you. We receive personal data about you from these parties in situations such as those listed here: Our trip reservation services are not only made available directly on our websites and mobile apps. They are also integrated into the services of strategic partners you can find online. When you make a reservation online using a service for which the strategic partner relies on Booking.com, we receive the reservation details via the strategic partner so that your reservation can be processed and supported. Trip providers may share information about you with Booking.com too. This could happen if you have support questions about a pending trip reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a trip reservation. We integrate with third-party payment service providers such as Adyen and Stripe to, for example, facilitate electronic payments between you, Booking.com, and trip providers. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your trip reservation. In some cases, we link to other business partners providing trip reservations that may not be available on our website or mobile apps. When you click on these, you’re redirected to other business partners’ websites, where you can make a reservation. These partners may share certain personal data related to your specific reservation and your interactions on these websites or mobile apps with us in accordance with their privacy policies. Our platform includes communication services such as email and chat messages. These communication services offer you a convenient way to contact the trip provider you’ve booked with to discuss specifics of your reservation such as available parking at an accommodation. The data we collect and process includes these communications. We may block the delivery of communications that we, at our sole discretion, believe might contain malicious content or spam, or pose a risk to you, trip providers, Booking.com, or others. We may also receive information (e.g. the additional cookie data our social media and marketing partners may make available to us on an aggregated basis) in order for us to measure the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns. When you link your Booking.com user account to a social media account you control, you might trigger exchanges of data between Booking.com and that social media provider. You can always choose to unlink your Booking.com user account by updating your Booking.com user account settings and preferences. We collect information in the regrettable case that we receive a complaint about you from a trip provider, for example in the case of possible misconduct. Purposes of collecting and processing your personal data We can only provide you with certain trip services if we can collect and process some personal data about you. For example, we can only process a trip reservation for you with your name and contact details. We use your personal data for a number of purposes as outlined here: A. Trip reservations First and foremost, we process your personal data to complete and administer your online trip reservation, which is essential to provide this service. This includes sending you communications that relate to your trip reservation, such as confirmations (including, where applicable, providing you with a proof of purchase and/or payment), modifications, and reminders. In some cases, this may also include processing your personal data to enable online check-in with the trip provider or processing personal data in relation to possible damage deposits. In addition to your contact details (e.g. email address, phone number), in order to provide you with services, we may also need reservation identifiers and dates to determine the duration of the reservation. B. Customer Service We provide our travelers with customer service in more than 40 languages, and we’re here to help 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Sharing reservation information with our global customer service staff is essential to help you when you need us. This includes, for example, helping you to contact the right trip provider and responding to any questions you might have about your trip reservation. To do this, we use personal data such as your reservation details, including, for example, the price of your reservation as well as how and when you made the reservation. C. User accounts As a user of our services, you can create an account for your use across our platform. With a user account, you can manage your trip reservations, take advantage of special offers, make future trip reservations more easily, and manage your personal settings. Managing personal settings gives you the ability to keep and share lists, share photos, easily see trip services you’ve searched for, and check travel-related information you’ve provided. You can also see any reviews you’ve written in connection with your trips. With your user account, you can also create a public profile under your own first name or with another name you choose. If you log in to the Booking.com platform with your user account and you want to create a Booking.com for Business account, we may use your name and email address to pre-fill the sign-up form. If you’re a Booking.com for Business user account holder, you can also save contact details under that user account, manage business reservations, and link other account holders to the same Booking.com for Business user account. To provide user accounts, we use personal data such as login credentials for accessing your user account and information about when the user account has been used in connection with reservations and payments, for example. D. Marketing activities We use your information for marketing activities. These activities include: Using your contact information and your interaction with our platform (such as previous reservations and behavioral data, including data collected via cookies and similar tracking technologies) to send you personalized marketing messages (e.g. push notifications, emails, platform notifications) from Booking.com, including promotions, Genius and other rewards, travel experiences, surveys, and updates about Booking.com’s products and services. You can unsubscribe from receiving email marketing communications quickly and easily at any time. Just click the ""Unsubscribe"" link included in each communication, or manage your preferences via your account settings. Based on your interaction with our platform (such as previous reservations and behavioral data, including data collected via cookies and similar tracking technologies), personalized marketing from Booking.com including promotions, Genius and other rewards, travel experiences, surveys, and updates about Booking.com’s products and services might be shown to you on the Booking.com website, on our mobile apps, or on third-party websites/apps. These may be offers and recommendations we think you may find interesting that you can book directly on our platform, on sites operated in partnership with a strategic partner, or on other third-party sites. Some of these recommendations may be produced on the basis of personal data we collected from you during different visits to our platform or on different devices, even when you aren’t logged in. Our page on “How we work” contains more information on our recommendation systems, including how you can manage your personalization preferences. We may contact you with information about insurance products that you didn’t include in your reservation. We may organize other promotional activities and, based on information already collected, we may invite you and other travelers to participate in such activities. To do this, we use personal data such as your contact and account information, browsing data, location data, and preferences, as well as searches and reservations you make from different devices. E. Communicating with you There may be times when we get in touch with you, including via email, chatbot, mail, phone call, push notification, platform notification, or text message. Which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve previously shared. We process personal data in communications you and other parties send to us. There may be a number of reasons for this, including: Responding to and handling any support requests made by you or the trip provider you booked with. We offer travelers and trip providers various ways to exchange information via our platform, such as regarding requests and comments about trip providers and trip reservations made via Booking.com. If you’ve started but not finished a trip reservation online, we might contact you to invite you to continue with your reservation. We believe this convenience benefits you because it allows you to pick up the process where you left off without having to search for a trip provider or fill in your reservation details again. When you use our trip services, we might send you a survey or otherwise invite you to provide a review about your experience with us or the trip provider. We also send you other material related to your trip reservations, such as how to contact us if you need help while you’re away and information that we feel might be useful to prepare for your trip and get the best experience. Even if you don’t have an upcoming trip, we may still need to send you other administrative messages, which could include security alerts. In case misconduct is reported to us by a trip provider, for example, we may send you a warning or other notice. To do this, we use personal data such as your first and last name, email address, and reservation details, including reservation IDs and chosen locations. F. Market research We sometimes invite our customers to participate in market research. Review the information that accompanies this kind of invitation to understand what personal data will be collected and how it’s used. G. Improving our services We use personal data about travelers using our platform for analytical purposes, including for analyzing how you or travelers like you with similar interests use our platform, measuring our operating performance and improving trip services. We may process your user ID, which is linked to the email address used if you created a user account, for the purpose of measuring the audience visiting our websites. Your personal data may be used by us to develop and enhance our machine learning models and artificial intelligence systems. This is a necessary part of our ongoing commitment to make our services better and enhance our travelers’ experience. For more details, see the How we use artificial intelligence and make automated decisions section. In addition to the statistics we generate regularly about our business, we use data to test and troubleshoot platform features. The main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they’re used, and ultimately how to optimize and customize our website and mobile apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use. As much as possible, we strive to use anonymized and de-identified personal data for this analytical work. To achieve this, we may combine personal data we collect from you during different visits to our platform or visits on different devices, even when you aren’t logged in. To do this, we use personal data such as: Reservations made by travelers over specific periods of time or for specific products The searches travelers made on our websites and apps The reviews travelers shared with us about their trip experience Our recurring work for analytical purposes includes the use of solutions that de-identify personal data or process personal data in encrypted formats. H. Showing the pricing applicable to you When you search our websites or mobile apps (e.g. to find an accommodation, a rental car, or flight), the pricing you see may depend on a number of factors, such as whether you’re in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another country. To display the pricing applicable to you, we use personal data such as your IP address, the type of device you’re using, and which site you came from. I. Customer reviews and other destination-related information During and after your trip, we might invite you to submit a review. We can also make it possible for the people you’re traveling with or for whom you’ve booked a reservation to do this instead. This invitation asks for information about the trip provider or the destination. If you have a Booking.com user account, you can choose to display a screen name next to your review, instead of your first name. By completing a review, you’re agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms of Service), for example, on: The relevant trip provider information page on our websites Our mobile apps Our social media accounts Websites operated by third-party companies such as trip providers. This helps to inform other travelers about the quality of the trip service you used, the destination you chose, or any other experiences you choose to share without disclosing your identity. Reviews submitted by travelers are subject to automated and other content moderation to verify that reviews conform with our Content standards and guidelines . J. Call monitoring When you make calls to our customer service team, we use an automated telephone number detection system to match the number you call from to the reservation you made. This saves time for you and our customer service staff. However, our customer service staff may still ask for further identification to further ensure your reservation details remain confidential. When you call our customer service team, we may have one or more authorized persons listen to the call or record the call for training and quality control purposes. This quality control includes the usage of the recordings to handle possible complaints, legal claims, and indications of possible fraud attempts. We don’t record every call made to our customer service team. If a call is recorded, it’s kept for a limited amount of time (30 days by default). We then automatically delete the call recording unless we determine before then that it will be necessary to retain it for fraud investigation or legal purposes. K. Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service and prevention of fraud We continuously analyze and use certain personal data to prevent and detect online fraud attempts and other illegal or unwanted activities. This is necessary to maintain our platform as a trustworthy environment as well as for the safety of all travelers. We use personal data for safety and security purposes, including when you report a safety concern, when others do so about you, or when we need to identify persons in connection with a user account or reservation. When we do this, we may have to stop or put certain reservations on hold until we’ve finished our assessment. If we have concerns about serious misconduct, we may decide to cancel your upcoming reservations or to decline future reservations via our platform. In case of safety or security concerns, we may process information from publicly available sources to prevent or detect harm. We cannot prevent that some of that information may contain special categories of personal data. In order to detect and prevent fraud and limit other abuse of our platform, we may use your personal data and analyze your behavior on our platform to assess the risk of a certain action or transaction you are attempting to make. For example, this may help us determine whether a bot is using our platform rather than a legitimate user, or to determine whether a user is making a fraudulent payment using a stolen credit card. To achieve this purpose, we use personal data such as your contact information, other identifiers (such as IP addresses), reservation details including canceled reservations, reviews, account information, browsing data, location data, communications data, or other information that you or another person has provided to us. We use artificial intelligence to review activity on our platform for fraud and to detect any other forms of misconduct as described in the section How we use artificial intelligence and make automated decisions . L. Legal purposes In certain cases, we may need to reuse your information to: Handle and resolve legal claims and disputes Address possible regulatory investigations Enforce our online reservation Terms of Service Comply with lawful requests from law enforcement Comply with laws and regulations that apply to Booking.com For example, we may be required to process your reservation history, the details of one or more of these reservations and associated payment information. Legal bases for personal data processing To process your personal data as described above, Booking.com relies on several legal bases provided for in applicable privacy regulations. This is summarized as follows: Purpose of personal data processing Legal basis and comments A. Trip reservations B. Customer service Here Booking.com relies on the legal basis that the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract involving you, specifically to finalize and administer your trip reservation. If the required personal data isn’t provided, Booking.com can’t finalize the trip reservation with the trip provider, nor can we provide customer service to you about it. C. User accounts D. Marketing activities E. Communicating with you F. Market research G. Improving our services H. Showing the pricing applicable to you I. Customer reviews and other destination-related information J. Call monitoring K. Promotion of safe and trustworthy service and prevention of fraud Unless provided otherwise in this overview, the collecting and processing of your personal data for these purposes is based on the legitimate interests of Booking.com or a third party. Before we process personal data to serve Booking.com’s or a third-party's legitimate interests, Booking.com balances your rights and interests in the protection of personal data with Booking.com’s rights and interests or those of the third party. The legitimate interests include, for example, avoiding financial harm from online fraud, sharing people’s experiences with prospective travelers, and keeping people informed about offers we think might be of interest. In the unlikely event Booking.com would process special categories of personal data in the context of purpose K, we rely, where applicable, on the fact that processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the individual or other legal bases as may be assessed at the time. L. Legal purposes Booking.com also relies, where applicable, on compliance with legal obligations (e.g. lawful law enforcement requests). All purpose categories Finally, where needed under evolving applicable law, Booking.com will obtain your consent prior to processing your personal data, including for direct marketing purposes or where otherwise required by law. If you want to object to the processing set out under C to L and no opt-out mechanism is available to you directly (e.g. in your user account settings), contact us as described in the Your rights section. How we share personal data within Booking.com To support the use of Booking.com services, your details may be shared within Booking.com group entities and the other Booking Holdings Inc. companies described in the section on Our company . How we share personal data within the Booking Holdings Inc. group We may receive personal data about you from other companies in the BHI group (e.g. Agoda or OpenTable), or share your personal data with them, for the following purposes: To provide services (including making, administering, and managing reservations or handling payments) To provide customer service To detect, prevent, and investigate fraudulent or other illegal activities and data breaches, companies within BHI may need to exchange personal data about certain persons to ensure all platform users are protected, for example, from online fraud attempts For analytical and product improvement purposes where permitted by applicable law To provide personalized offers or send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law For hosting, technical support, overall maintenance, and maintaining security of such shared data To ensure compliance with applicable laws As applicable and unless indicated otherwise, for purposes A to F we rely on our legitimate interests to share and receive personal data. For purpose G , we rely, where applicable, on compliance with legal obligations (such as lawful law enforcement requests). We also ensure that data flows between companies in the BHI group comply with applicable law. Where needed under applicable law, we will obtain your consent before sharing your personal data with other companies in the BHI group. How we share personal data with third parties In certain circumstances, we’ll share your personal data with third parties. These third parties include: The trip provider you booked with In order to complete your trip reservation, we need to transfer relevant reservation details to the trip provider you have chosen. Depending on the trip reservation and the trip provider, the details we share can include your name, contact and payment details, the names of the people accompanying you, and any other relevant information (e.g. check-in/check-out dates), including preferences you specified when you made your trip reservation. In certain cases, we also provide some summary information about you to the trip provider. This can include: Whether you’ve already booked with the trip provider in the past The number of completed reservations you’ve made with us The absence of reports to Booking.com regarding misconduct involving you The percentage of reservations you may have canceled in the past on our platform Whether you’ve given reviews about past reservations If you have a query about your trip, we may contact the trip provider to handle your request. Unless payment is made to Booking.com itself during the reservation process, we need to forward your credit card details to the trip provider you chose for payment processing. To resolve possible trip-related claims or disputes or any other kind of customer service issue, we may provide the trip provider on an as-needed basis with your contact details and other information about the reservation, claim, or dispute. This can include, for example, your email address and a copy of your reservation confirmation to confirm that the trip reservation was made or the reasons for its cancellation. Trip providers will further process your personal data outside of the control of Booking.com to prepare for arriving and departing guests, for example. Trip providers may also ask for additional personal data, for instance to provide additional services and to comply with local requirements and restrictions. If available, read the privacy statement of the trip provider to understand how they process your personal data. Strategic partners We work with many strategic partners around the world. These strategic partners distribute and advertise Booking.com’s services, including the services and products of our trip providers. Depending on the strategic partner, you may make your trip reservation through: our website that’s operated in partnership with a strategic partner; or strategic partners’ websites or mobile apps. For the former, the strategic partners will receive certain personal data related to your specific reservation and your interactions on these websites. This is for their commercial purposes. For the latter, certain personal data that you give them, such as your name and email address, your address, payment details, and other relevant information, will be forwarded to us to finalize and manage your trip reservation. With these strategic partners, we may act as joint controllers for processing of specific personal data. If you choose to exercise your data subject rights with our strategic partners, we may collaborate to ensure an adequate response to your request. For fraud detection and prevention purposes, we may also exchange information about our users with strategic partners – but only when strictly necessary. Connectivity providers Many trip providers contract with specific third-party companies (often referred to as “connectivity providers”) to automate the routing of reservation information from Booking.com and other members of the travel industry to them. Connectivity providers act on behalf of trip providers (rather than Booking.com) and forward reservation information to them so they can manage their reservations in their systems. Third-party service providers We use service providers from outside of the Booking Holdings Inc. company group to support us in providing our trip services. The services these third-party companies provide include: Customer support Industry/market research Fraud detection and prevention (including anti-fraud screening) Insurance coverage claims handling Payment processing We use third parties to electronically process payments, handle chargebacks, or provide billing collection services. The payment service providers may, in some cases, use your personal data for their own purposes, such as to detect and prevent fraud attempts and to comply with legal requirements applicable to them. When a chargeback is requested for your trip reservation, either by you or by the holder of the credit card used to make your reservation, we need to share certain reservation details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial service organization so they can handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of your reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make your reservation. We may also share information with relevant financial institutions if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud prevention purposes, for example, to prevent the fraudulent use of a stolen credit card. Marketing services We may share some of your personal data (such as identifiers) with advertising partners as part of the marketing of our trip services via third parties (to ensure that relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience). We use techniques such as hashing specific personal data (e.g. email address, phone number) to enable matching with data in one or more of their databases. Such techniques limit what the receiving third-party company can do with the personal data we selectively share with them. Other professional third parties In some cases (e.g. disputes, legal claims, or as part of auditing activities), we may need to share your personal data with representatives of professional service organizations. These representatives can include legal counsels at law firms as well as auditors. We only share your personal data to the extent that is necessary and in line with contractual and other obligations applicable to them. Competent authorities We follow specific protocols when law enforcement agencies and other government bodies request us to disclose to them personal data about one or more travelers in connection with a possible criminal matter. We may also disclose personal data to law enforcement agencies in connection with possible cases of fraud. We follow similar protocols where, for example, EU and local laws additionally require us to share personal data with the competent authority, such as a tax authority. Such disclosures by us may be required to: Comply with a legal obligation, for instance, under applicable short-term rental laws Protect and defend our rights or the rights and interests of our business partners. Other business partners We may share personal data in other instances with other business partners. These include: Insurance companies: If an insurance claim is made, concerning you and a trip provider, we may provide the necessary data (including personal data) to the insurance company and their appointed representatives for further processing. Other trip providers: We may present you with a “Partner offer.” When you book a stay marked “Partner offer,” your reservation will be facilitated by a trip provider who is separate from the accommodation you’re booking. As part of the reservation process, we’ll need to share some relevant personal data with this trip provider. If you book a “Partner offer,” review the information provided in the reservation process or check your reservation confirmation for more information about the trip provider and how your personal data will be further processed by them. Safeguards for international transfers of personal data Booking.com is a business that connects travelers and partners around the world. The data that we collect from you, as described in this privacy statement, could be made accessible from, transferred to, or stored in countries that may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. In any case, we apply appropriate safeguards to make sure that cross-border transfers of personal data comply with applicable law and seek to ensure that your data continues to receive a comparable level of protection. In particular, if you’re in the European Economic Area (EEA) and your personal data is transferred to third-party service providers in countries not considered adequate by the European Commission (EC), we establish and implement appropriate contractual, organizational, and technical measures with these third-party companies. This is done by using Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the EC, by examining the countries to which the data may be transferred, and by imposing specific technical and organizational measures. In certain cases, we transfer your data outside the EEA because it’s necessary to conclude or perform the contract we have with you. For example, if you make a trip reservation involving a trip provider or strategic partner operating outside the EEA, it’s likely to require that we transfer data about your specific reservation outside of the EEA. For transfers of your personal data outside of the United Kingdom (UK), we apply the equivalent mechanisms and appropriate safeguards for the UK. You can ask us for more information on our implemented safeguards by contacting us as described in the section Your rights . Information regarding specific markets and products & services Depending on the type of product or service that concerns you and other factors such as where you live, we may have additional information to provide you that supplements or even replaces the information elsewhere in this notice. Review the sections below that apply to you in order to get the full picture. Ground transportation If your use of our services includes ground transportation, the information in this section applies to you. It adds to, or replaces, the information in other parts of this privacy statement. In addition to what we list in Personal data you give to us , for a car rental reservation we might also ask for your home address, billing address, phone number, date and place of birth, passport and driver’s license info, government-issued ID (where required by law), and the names of any additional drivers. For a private or public transport reservation, we might ask for your pick-up and drop-off address (if you book a ride or airport transfer). We might also ask for your date of birth or age range for some public transportation tickets (e.g. child or senior tickets) and the names of any additional passengers. In addition to what is described in the Personal data we receive from other sources section, car rental, private, or public transit companies may also share information about you with us. This could happen if you need support with or have questions about a pending reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a reservation. In addition to what is described in Purposes of collecting and processing your personal data , we may use your personal data in relation to customer reviews. During and after your trip, we might invite you to submit a review. This is to inform others about the quality of the ground transportation provider you used and any other experiences you choose to share. This invite asks for information about the provider and your experience. You can choose to display a screen name next to your review, instead of your real name. In addition to what is described in How we share personal data with third parties , if the car rental company you select on our platform participates in our pre-registration program, the details we share can also include your email address, home address, phone number, date and place of birth, passport, and driver’s license information if you’ve provided this information to us at your sole discretion. Providing further pre-registration information will enhance your pick-up experience, but it’s optional and you’ll still be able to pick up your rental car even if you don’t provide any pre-registration information. Note that, sometimes, at the direction of the ground transportation provider, we’ll need to share your personal data with parties related to the provider in order to finalize and administer your reservation. These parties might include other entities of the provider’s corporate group or service providers, drivers, or end fleets who are handling the data on the provider’s behalf. Car rental companies may also ask for additional personal data, for example, to provide additional services or to comply with local restrictions. Be aware that any information you provide directly to the company/companies supplying your car and/or related products will be stored and used in accordance with their own privacy statement(s) and terms and conditions. Return to main notice Insurance If you purchase an insurance product while using our platform, the information in this section applies to you. It adds to, or replaces, the information in other parts of this privacy statement. The offering of insurance can involve multiple parties, such as intermediaries, underwriters, and other agents. Where Booking.com Distribution B.V. is involved, it will act as the intermediary and authorized agent or appointed representative (depending on the jurisdiction) on behalf of the insurer, by offering insurance products and services to Booking.com customers. Review the information provided during the reservation process for more information about us and the parties who work together with us to offer you these products and services. The details of the insurer will be visible in the insurance policy and related documentation provided to you. When offering insurance, we may have to use and share personal data that is relevant to the insurance product. This data relates to you as a potential or actual policyholder, the beneficiaries under a policy, family members, claimants, and other parties involved in a claim: To provide offers, arrange insurance cover and handle insurance claims, some personal data, provided to us during the reservation process (“General Order Data”), may have to be shared within other Booking.com entities. You may also be asked to provide additional information, such as names of family members or other beneficiaries or details about a claim (“Insurance-Specific Data”). If you make a claim under an insurance policy, this claim may be directly handled by the insurer. This means that you may be asked to provide personal data in order to submit the claim directly to them. The insurer will inform you accordingly at the point of collection of your information. When your claim is handled by the insurer, we may receive information about the status of your claim in order to provide you with customer support services. For more information on the relationship between Booking.com and Booking.com Distribution B.V., and to exercise your rights regarding personal data collected via the Booking.com platform, contact us as described in the Your rights section. Insurance-related call recordings may be kept for longer than the default 30 days applied to other call recordings in order to comply with specific provisions from insurance-related laws and regulations. Return to main notice How we protect personal data We combine people, processes, and technology to protect your personal data and respect your privacy. This includes, among other things, that we: Maintain a comprehensive framework of security policies, procedures, and protocols Employ personnel dedicated to cybersecurity and data protection Keep staff alert to security risks through continual security training and awareness activities Use up-to-date security technologies such as encryption and data leakage prevention to help guard against unauthorized data disclosure or destruction Maintain inventories to provide oversight over processes, systems, and data assets Use multiple systems for fraud prevention/detection and continuous system monitoring, including for security purposes Use identity and access management and other logical and physical access restrictions to control that only authorized personnel can access personal data Maintain and test protocols to respond to reports about possible incidents and data breaches Verify and enhance our security systems, procedures, and protocols on a recurring basis Impose equivalent measures on third parties we appoint We use retention practices to keep and, where possible under applicable law, dispose of personal data. Generally, we keep your personal data for as long as is necessary to: Enable you to use our services or to provide our services to you Prevent and detect online fraud attempts and/or other illegal activities Comply with legal obligations such as those from accounting and tax laws Resolve any disputes and legal claims How you can further protect your personal data on Booking.com While not mandatory for your use of Booking.com’s platform, we recommend that you: Use a user account where available on our platform. By using a user account, you can protect access to your data (e.g. your reservation history, your Wallet) with a strong password as well as two-factor authentication. Use unique passwords for every online service including for your access to Booking.com. If you reuse user account and password combinations across multiple services on the internet and one of them suffers a data leak, malicious actors typically try using the same combinations to access your user accounts on other online services, such as Booking.com. Where we detect such malicious attacks to the detriment of travelers, we take countermeasures rapidly, such as blocking user accounts at risk and alerting account holders. Read (and follow the guidance from) articles we may make available to travelers and partners about online fraud prevention and data protection. Online fraud attempts typically involve social engineering and “phishing” schemes where scammers may pretend to be, for example, a specific accommodation and ask for payment when it’s not necessary. You should contact Customer Service if you suspect there is a possible fraud attempt in connection with your reservation.

Nyt,https://nyt.com,https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/cookie-policy#how-do-i-manage-trackers,"The Times and Your Data Cookie Policy The New York Times Company Cookie Policy Last revised on September 9, 2024 This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking methods (such as pixels, SDKs, JavaScript, local storage, device identifiers, etc., which we refer to as “trackers”) when you visit our site. “Our site” means our websites, emails, apps and other services that link to this Cookie Policy, like nytimes.com and its subdomains, including The Athletic and Wirecutter. This policy explains what various tracking methods are, and why they are used. It also explains your right to control their use. We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Check the “last revised” date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any change becomes effective when we post the revised Cookie Policy on or through our site. Where we use trackers to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, our Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy. If you have any questions, please contact us by email at privacy@nytimes.com. You can also write to us: The New York Times Company, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, attn.: Legal Department. If you have any questions regarding The Athletic, please contact The Athletic at privacy@theathletic.com. Page Contents 1 What Is a Tracker? 2 What Trackers Do We Use And For Which Purpose? 3 How Do I Manage Trackers? 1 . What Is a Tracker? We use a variety of tracker methods; six of the main types are explained below. This list is intended to include all categories that we use, although the categories may vary depending on the use of our site. We use trackers to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the services through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base so that we can improve our services and your experience. We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through trackers with other personal information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Please reference the descriptions below to learn more about the kinds of trackers we use and for what purpose. A) Cookies A cookie is a small string of text that a website (or online service) stores on a user’s browser. It saves data on your browser about your visit to our site or other sites. It often includes a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123). “First-party cookies” are cookies set by us (or on our behalf) on our site. “Third-party cookies” are cookies set by other companies whose functionality is embedded into our site (e.g., google.com). “Session cookies” are temporary cookies stored on your device while you visit our site. They expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” are stored on your browser for a period of time after you leave our site. Persistent cookies expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually. We use persistent cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit. This allows us, for example, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our services, how often you return, how your use of the services may vary over time, to target advertising, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services and customize your online experience. You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. However, if cookies are refused, your experience on our site may be worse, and some features may not work as intended. B) Pixels Pixels (also known as “web beacons,” “GIFs” or “bugs”) are one-pixel transparent images located on web pages or messages. They track whether you have opened these web pages or messages. Upon firing, a pixel logs a visit to the current page or message and may read or set cookies. Pixels often rely on cookies to work, so turning off cookies can impair them. But even if you turn off cookies, pixels can still detect a web page visit. C) Javascript JavaScript is a programming language. It can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our site and other sites. D) Software Development Kits (or SDKs) SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., third-party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps to collect and analyze certain device and user data. E) Device Identifiers Device identifiers are user-resettable identifiers comprised of numbers and letters. They are unique to a specific device. They are stored directly on the device. They are used to recognize you and/or your devices(s) on, off and across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes. F) ID Synching In order to decide what type of ad might interest you, our digital and marketing vendors sometimes link data — inferred from your browsing of other sites or collected from other sources — using a method knowns as “ID synching” or “cookie synching.” To do this, they match the tracker ID they have assigned to you with one or more tracker IDs that are held in another company’s database and that are likely also associated with you. Any of the linked trackers may have certain interests and other demographic information attributed to it. That information is then used to determine which ad to show you. Back to top 2 . What Trackers Do We Use And For Which Purpose? Below is a list of the types of trackers that appear on our site. Essential Trackers Essential trackers are required for our site to operate and to provide you with the features or services that you have requested. They allow you to navigate our site and use its services and features (e.g., cookies that help you stay logged in). Without essential trackers, our site will not run smoothly; in fact, our site (or certain services or features) might not even be available to you simply because of technical limitations. Analytics Trackers Analytics trackers collect or use information about your site use, which helps us improve our site. Among the uses of analytics trackers are to show us which pages are most frequently visited, help us record difficulties you have with our site, track subscription purchases and behaviors leading to subscription purchases, and measure how well ads perform. These trackers add up our readers’ visits to show us larger patterns in our audience. We look at these larger patterns to analyze site traffic. Marketing Trackers These trackers help us determine which ads to show you for Times properties — both on our site and on other sites. To do this, these trackers use information about your behavior on various sites to target our ads. These trackers allow us to limit the number of times you see our ad across your devices. They help us personalize the ads we show you. They also enable us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (e.g., measure if you subscribe after seeing our ads). Advertising Trackers Advertising trackers help us and our advertising partners to determine which ads from third parties are selected for you. Some of these trackers collect or use information about your behavior and browsing habits on our services and other sites (including the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). They also collect your demographic details, interests and certain technical information about your browser or device to aid this targeting. These trackers sometimes limit the number of times you see an ad, make an ad more relevant to you or measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign. We may not have control or access to such trackers. If you look at one page on our services, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our services or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We work with advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors to serve these ads, who often use their own trackers through our site. The ads served can include additional trackers which are activated when an ad is visible to you or when you click on or otherwise interact with an ad. Back to top 3 . How Do I Manage Trackers? In certain jurisdictions, when you first come to our site, you will receive a banner notification that trackers are present. By clicking or tapping “accept all,” you agree to the use of these trackers as described here. You can manage your tracker settings at any time by clicking on “Manage Privacy Preferences” in our website footer or in your app “Privacy Settings”, or “Account Settings” for the Athletic app. In addition, you can refuse or accept trackers from our site (or any other site) in your browser’s settings. If you refuse trackers, you might not be able to sign in or use other tracker-dependent features of our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but this is typically something you can adjust. Information for each browser can be found in the links below: Safari on desktop and Safari Mobile (iPhone and iPads) : Note that, by default, Safari is engineered to protect you from being tracked from site to site unless you disable Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Firefox : By default, Firefox protects you from cross-site tracking so long as you have not disabled Total Cookie Protection. There is therefore less need to manage cookies to protect your privacy. Chrome Microsoft Edge : Enabling tracking prevention with Edge will protect you from being tracked between sites, such that there will be less of a need to manage your cookies in order to protect your privacy. Samsung Internet Browser : By default, Samsung Internet Browser enables the “Smart anti-tracking“ function that will help block third parties attempting to track your personal information. Brave : By default, Brave protects you from cross-site tracking by blocking third-party cookies. For more information about other browsers, please refer to this “All About Cookies” guide . For more information about trackers, including information about how to manage and delete trackers, please visit the ICO’s website . To opt out of Google Analytics data collection, follow these Google instructions . To reset your device identifier, follow Google instructions and Apple instructions . The third-party advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors with which we work may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising and/or the European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA). To opt out of interest-based advertising from the participating companies, please visit AboutAds.info or the European Digital Advertising Alliance for laptops and NAI Mobile Choices or AppChoices for mobile devices. Note that opting out through these channels does not mean you will no longer see ads and is specific to the device and browser you are using. You will still receive other types of ads from these companies, and any type of ad from nonparticipating companies. The sites you visit may still collect your information for other purposes. Your browser may offer you a ""Do Not Track"" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Please note that The Athletic does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity while you are using The Athletic. Contact Us If you have any queries regarding this Cookie Policy, please contact us at privacy@nytimes.com.

Business Settlement reached in investors' lawsuit against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders July 17, 2025 7:49 PM ET By The Associated Press Former Meta board member and former White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients, left, exits the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center after testifying in a shareholders' lawsuit against current and former Meta leaders on Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in Wilmington, Del. Mingson Lau/AP hide caption toggle caption Mingson Lau/AP A settlement was announced Thursday in court in a class action investors' lawsuit against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and current and former company leaders over claims stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. The suit had sought billions of dollars in reimbursement for fines and legal costs. No details on the settlement were shared when it was announced in Delaware's Court of Chancery at the start of what would have been the second day of trial, at which point nothing related to the settlement had been filed with the court. Technology Meta plans to replace humans with AI to assess privacy and societal risks The attorneys involved left court without commenting. A communications representative from Meta said the company had no comment. Investors had alleged in the lawsuit that Meta did not fully disclose the risks to Facebook users that their personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump's successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016. Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data without users' consent. Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleged. The Indicator from Planet Money Could Meta do more to protect us from cyber scams? Facebook agreed to pay a $5.1 billion penalty to settle FTC charges in the fallout. The social media giant also faced significant fines in Europe and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users. Shareholders wanted Zuckerberg and others to reimburse Meta an estimated $8 billion or more for the FTC fine and other legal costs. Zuckerberg and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg had been expected to testify. Other current and former board members, including billionaires Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel, were also included as defendants. Earlier this year, Sandberg was sanctioned for deleting emails from her personal account related to the Cambridge Analytica investigation. Jeffrey Zients, who served as an outside director from 2018 to 2020, avoided sanctions in the same case because his role made it less likely he had access to relevant information. Testifying on the first day of this lawsuit, Zients said he had supported the FTC settlement for which shareholders were seeking reimbursement.

Photograph: Mingson Lau/AP View image in fullscreen Jeffrey Zients on Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware. Photograph: Mingson Lau/AP Zuckerberg and Meta officers settle claim they lost company billions by violating privacy laws Shareholders sued Zuckerberg and others in hopes of holding them liable for fines and legal costs that Meta paid Mark Zuckerberg and current and former directors and officers of Meta Platforms agreed on Thursday to settle claims seeking $8bn for the damage they allegedly caused the company by allowing repeated violations of Facebook users’ privacy, a lawyer for the shareholders told a Delaware judge on Thursday. The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware court of chancery. McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she congratulated the parties. The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement came together quickly. Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and a Meta director, was scheduled to testify on Thursday. Shareholders of Meta sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen and other former company officials including Sheryl Sandberg, the former chief operating officer, in hopes of holding them liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company paid in recent years. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Facebook $5bn in 2019 after finding that it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement with the regulator to protect users’ data. The shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. The defendants denied the allegations, which they called “extreme claims”. Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. The company was not a defendant. The company declined to comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “This settlement may bring relief to the parties involved, but it’s a missed opportunity for public accountability,” said Jason Kint, the head of Digital Content Next, a trade group for content providers. Zuckerberg was expected to take the stand on Monday and Sandberg on Wednesday. The trial was scheduled to run through the end of next week. The case was also expected to include testimony from the former Facebook board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix . Meta investors alleged in the lawsuit that former and current board members completely failed to oversee the company’s compliance with the 2012 FTC agreement and claim that Zuckerberg and Sandberg knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation. The case followed revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Those revelations led to the FTC fine, which was a record at the time. On Wednesday, an expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about what he called “gaps and weaknesses” in Facebook’s privacy policies but would not say if the company violated the 2012 agreement that Facebook reached with the FTC. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Jeffrey Zients, a former board member, testified on Wednesday that the company did not agree to the FTC fine to spare Zuckerberg legal liability, as shareholders allege. On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019. The trial would have been a rare opportunity for Meta investors to see Zuckerberg answer probing questions under oath. In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving a lawsuit by company investors opposed to his plan to issue a special class of Facebook stock that would have extended his control over that company. That case was also settled before he took the stand. “Facebook has successfully remade the ‘Cambridge Analytica’ scandal about a few bad actors rather than an unraveling of its entire business model of surveillance capitalism and the reciprocal, unbridled sharing of personal data,” Kint said. “That reckoning is now left unresolved.” Explore more on these topics Meta Mark Zuckerberg Delaware news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed",success,4400,2025-07-18 12:27:09

Change of Control In the event we go through a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process), your Personal Data will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your Personal Data, you agree that we can transfer such information in those circumstances without your further consent. Should such a business transition occur, we will make reasonable efforts to request that the new owner or combined entity (as applicable) follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Data. If your Personal Data would be used contrary to this Privacy Policy, we will request that you receive prior notice. Other Disclosure Scenarios We reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share User Information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (ii) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (iii) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (iv) to protect and defend our legal rights or property, our services or their users, or any other party, and to protect the health and safety of our users or the general public; and (v) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy). Anonymous Data When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third-party. We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. Anonymous data will include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make Personal Data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name or other personal identifiers) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Services. Public Information If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly. For example, you can elect to make certain of your User Submissions (such as your alias, bio, email or photos) publicly available. Also, there are areas of the Services (for example, message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) in which you are able to post information that automatically will be available to all other users of the Services. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone can access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas. Users Outside of the United States and Consent to Transfer The Services are operated in the United States. If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us will be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may be different than those in the jurisdiction where you reside or are a citizen, such as the European Union. You understand that the U.S. government can obtain access to the Personal Data you submit if necessary for investigative purposes (e.g., terrorism investigation). We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We use appropriate and suitable safeguards for transferring your Personal Data to the U.S. How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals Internet browsers can be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. Except as required by applicable law, the Services do not alter their practices when they receive a “Do Not Track” signal automatically from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit here . Advertising Generally We use other companies under agreements with us to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services. These companies may collect and use clickstream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to the Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information. Other companies’ use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. In addition, we share with these third parties any Personal Data you voluntarily provide, such as an email address, in response to an advertisement or sponsored content link. Targeted Advertising In order to serve offers and advertisements that may be of interest to our users, we display targeted advertisements on the Services, or other digital properties or applications in conjunction with our content, based on information provided to us by our users and information provided to us by third parties that they have independently collected. Your Ad Choices Some of the third-party services providers and/or Advertisers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). You can visit here , which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You can opt-out of the use of your behavioral data used by DAA members to serve you interest-based advertising on third-party sites here . If you are accessing the Services through an application (i.e., mobile phone or tablet) you can download the AppChoices application from your device’s application store (i.e., Google Play, Apple App Store, and Amazon Store). This DAA application allows participating companies to offer an opt-out of customized advertisements that are based on predictions about your interests generated from your application usage. For more information, visit here . Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online or on your device. Mobile We may from time to time offer certain location or pinpoint based services, such as location assisted navigation instruction. If you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide such location-based services to you. By using the location-based services, you authorize us to: (i) locate your hardware; (ii) record, compile and display your location; and (iii) publish your location to third parties designated by you by means of location publication controls available within the applications (for example, settings, user preferences). As part of the location-based services, we also collect and store certain information about the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device id. This information will be used to provide you the location-based services. We use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through mobile systems (unless you opt out of such location-based services with such providers) and we provide the information to such providers to enable them to provide their location-based services, provided that such providers use the information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Choice/Opt-Out From Communications We offer you the opportunity to manage your communications from us. Even after subscribing to one or more newsletters and/or opting in to one or more offers to receive marketing and/or promotional communications from us or our third-party partners, users may elect to modify their preferences by following the “Communications Preferences” and/or “Unsubscribe” link provided in an email or communication received. If you no longer wish to receive text messages from us, please follow the instructions provided in our text message. You may also be able to change your preferences by updating your profile or account, depending on which of our Services you are using. Please be aware that if you wish to remove yourself from a newsletter and/or other marketing emails from third parties that you consented to through the Services, you must do so by contacting the relevant third-party. Even if you do opt-out of marketing emails, we reserve the right to send you transactional and administrative emails including those related to the Services, service announcements, notices of changes to this Privacy Policy or other Services policies, and to contact you regarding any goods or services you have ordered. Retaining, Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Data You may request access to the information you have provided to us. If you wish to make a request, please contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. If you would like to update, correct, modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you previously submitted to us, please let us know by logging in and updating your profile. If you delete certain information you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Also, please note that we will maintain Personal Data in our database whenever we are required to do so by law, for necessary operational reasons, or to maintain uniform business practices. Please note that we need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (for example, when you enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such promotion). We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Security We have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. You use the Services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section below. Links The Services contain links to other websites that we do not control, and the Services contain videos, advertising and other content hosted and served by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party. We may also integrate with third parties who will interact with you under their terms of service. Children’s Privacy We especially care about the privacy of young children. Most of our Services, with the exception of certain child-directed services as described below, are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and should not be used by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 on our general audience services, and we do not target such services to children under the age of 16. Some of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as our Dodo Kids channel or other child-directed services). In connection with such child-directed services, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures. We are committed to compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. federal law designed to protect children online. We may collect and store persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses) from children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA. For any of our Services, if a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable. Sensitive Personal Data When we conduct research or carry out surveys and you participate in our research or surveys, we may collect sensitive Personal Data about you, for example, information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation. We will get your explicit consent for our collection, use, or sharing of this data where required by law. Otherwise, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data as this term is defined under applicable data protection and privacy laws on or through the Services or otherwise to us. If you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Data to us or the public through the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data, you must not submit such content to our Services, and you must contact us to make us aware immediately.

Other services you link to your account : We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate third-party apps, like Power-UPs, or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, disclose and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface. Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users. Your administrator may also authorize our Services to connect with a third party reporting service so your organization can review how the Services are being used. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services. Atlassian Companies : We receive information about you from other Atlassian corporate affiliates, in accordance with their terms and policies. Atlassian Partners : We work with a global network of partners who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.

We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian Services you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in. Other Partners : We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements. Third Party Providers : We may receive information about you from third party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles, for the purposes of targeted advertising of products that may interest you, delivering personalized communications, event promotion, and profiling. How we use information we collect How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you. To provide the Services and personalize your experience : We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate, maintain, and improve the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function. We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites. Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you. To opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com. For research and development : We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful. We use information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users. We automatically analyze and aggregate search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users. To communicate with you about the Services : We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a page or ticket, when a task is assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board. Depending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings. To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications. These communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under ""Opt-out of communications."" Customer support : We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services. Where you give us express permission to do so, we disclose information to a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests. For safety and security : We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations of Service policies. To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights : Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business. With your consent : We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission. Legal bases for processing (for EEA users) : If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where: We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services. How we disclose information we collect We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means disclosing information through the Services and to certain third parties. We disclose information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers. Please note that information about you, your devices, and your behavior collected through third-party cookies, pixels, tags, or other tracking technologies for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising may be considered a “sale” or “share” under certain US state laws. However, Atlassian is not a data broker, and we do not sell personal information for monetary consideration. Disclosing to other Service users When you use the Services, we disclose certain information about you to other Service users. For collaboration : You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, disclose, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you disclose or interact with specific content. For example, when you comment on a Confluence page or Jira work item, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment. Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well. Your team’s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments. Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages, Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space, including information about you, can be publicly viewed, indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines. You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator. Managed accounts and administrators : If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may disclose your contact information to current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests. Community Forums : Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g., Atlassian Community , Atlassian Developer Community , Trello Community , and Trello Inspiration ). You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.

All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties, excluding aggregators and providers of the text messaging services. Service Providers : We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, marketing, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information. Atlassian Partners : We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may disclose your information to these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure. Third Party Apps : You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. If you are an administrator, or a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we disclose your details to the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being disclosed to these third parties, please uninstall the app. Links to Third Party Sites : The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit. Third Party Services: We may offer you the ability to interact with or disclose information to third parties through the Services. For example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services. When you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may disclose certain information to those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service. Such information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information. Third Party Widgets : Some of our services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter ""tweet"" button or Facebook ""like"" button. These widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information. With your consent : We disclose information about you to third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial. Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights : In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement and our Transparency Report . Disclosing to affiliated companies We disclose information we collect to affiliated companies and, in some cases, to prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances. Atlassian companies : We disclose information we have about you to other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you. This includes companies that own or operate the Services. Business Transfers : We may disclose or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information. How we store and secure information we collect Information storage and security We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the Atlassian Trust , Trello Trust , and Jira Align Trust pages. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian. We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used. How long we keep information How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. Account information : We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. Information you share on the Services : If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be removed. Managed accounts : If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For more information, see ""Managed accounts and administrators"" above. Marketing information : If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created. How to access and control your information You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. Your Choices : Where applicable under local law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information. Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have the right to request information about our processing of your information, to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, to request your information in a structured, electronic format, to request to correct or update your information, to request to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” of personal information and targeted advertising (as these terms are defined under applicable law), and to request to opt out of certain profiling activities. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see ""Notice to End Users"" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance. Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to disclose data to third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed. Where applicable under local law, you may also contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below to appeal any decision we make relating to your request to exercise your rights. Access and update your information : Our Services and related documentation (see Atlassian Documentation , Trello Help , and Loom Documentation ) give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content. Deactivate your account : If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team through Atlassian ’s support pages. Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below. Delete your information : Our Services and related documentation (see Atlassian Documentation , and Loom Documentation ) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations. Request that we stop using your information : In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for certain marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being disclosed to a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so. Opt out of communications : You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads. If personal data is to be used in a way not previously disclosed, or shared with external parties not covered in this policy, you will be provided the opportunity to opt-out. Opt out of targeted advertising : Where applicable under local law, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising by clicking here and following the instructions. You may also be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Turn off Cookie Controls : Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our Cookies & Tracking Notice . Please refer to Loom’s Cookie Policy for details on cookies and tracking technologies used within Loom products and websites. Send ""Do Not Track"" Signals : Some browsers have incorporated ""Do Not Track"" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Our websites may not respond to all browser-based DNT signals; however, our websites do respond to the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to opt-out of “sales” of personal information and targeted advertising in certain locales. For more information on the GPC and how to use a browser or browser extension incorporating the GPC signal, see https://globalprivacycontrol.org/ . You can also use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above. Data portability : Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.

In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the ‘ Customer Agreement ’), including the processing of data such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, ‘ Customer Data ’). The organisation (e.g. your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (the ‘ Customer ’) controls its instance of the Services (its ‘ Workspace ’) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check http://slack.com/account/team for the contact information of your workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation. California notice of collection of personal information: We collect the information described below under ‘Information we collect and receive’ for the business and commercial purposes described below under ‘Information use’. To learn more about exercising your California privacy rights, please review the ‘California privacy rights’ section below. Information we collect and receive Slack will collect and receive information through operating the Services and Websites, and through other interactions with Slack. Such information will include Customer Data and other information and data (‘ Other Information ’) in a variety of ways: Customer Data . Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (‘ Authorised Users ’) routinely submit Customer Data (such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts) to Slack when using the Services. Other Information. Slack also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other Information: Workspace and account information : To create or update a Workspace account, you or our Customer (e.g. your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or other account set-up details (for more detail on Workspace creation, click here . In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address. Usage information: Services metadata . When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that an Authorised User uses the Services. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links that you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any). Log data . As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page that you visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time that the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and your language preferences. Device information . Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings. Location information . We receive information from you, our Customers and other third parties that helps us to approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location to assist with localisation or for security purposes. Cookie information : Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our Cookie policy . Third-Party Services information : A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace and Slack can receive personal data from such Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorised Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace (for more details on third-party application management, settings and permissions, click here ). Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application that you are using is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorised Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorised Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorised to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including by its Authorised User(s)). Examples of information which Slack may receive in this manner include whether you successfully created a new account or interacted with a third-party application in a way that is attributable to Slack usage activity. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Slack’s interaction with Third-Party Services, click here . Contact information : In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorised User chooses to import (such as importing an address book to find colleagues and Slack Connect contacts or calendar from a device or API), forward or upload to the Services (for example, when sending emails to the Services) is collected when using the Services. Third-party data : Slack may receive data about organisations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information that we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to postcodes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed. Audio and video metadata : Slack may receive, capture and store metadata derived from your use of features such as Slack huddles or clips, and additional related data such as data regarding the date and time of your Slack huddle and the Authorised User that you connected with. Additional information provided to Slack : We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as responses or opinions that you provide if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback that you provide about our products or services, information that you provide if you apply for a job with Slack, enrol in a certification programme or other educational programme hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack. Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively “ Information ”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services. How we process your information and our legal bases for doing so Customer Data will be used by Slack in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including to provide the Services, any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, a Customer’s use of Services functionality and as required by applicable law. Slack is a processor of Customer Data and the Customer is the controller.

Slack uses Other Information to operate our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, Slack uses Other Information for the following purposes: Compliance with a legal obligation: Slack processes Other Information when we comply with a legal obligation including, for example, to access, preserve or disclose certain information if there is a valid legal request from a regulator, law enforcement or others. For example, a search warrant or production order from law enforcement to provide information in relation to an investigation, such as your profile picture or IP address. We use Workspace and account information, usage information, cookie information, Third-Party Services information, contact information, third-party data, audio and video metadata, and additional information provided to Slack for compliance with a legal obligation.

It is in our interest to promote the Websites and Services and send our direct marketing. How we share and disclose information This section describes how Slack may share and disclose Information, as described in the section entitled ‘Information we collect and receive’ above. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information to third parties. Slack does not control how a Customer or any third party chooses to share or disclose Information. The Customer’s instructions. Slack may share and disclose Information in accordance with a Customer’s instructions and with appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer’s use of Services functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Some sharing at a Customer’s request may incur additional fees. To enable Slack to follow our Customers’ instructions, Slack provides several administrator controls to allow Customers to manage their Workspaces. For example, we follow our Customers’ instructions to enable or disable Authorised Users’ use of various features of the Services, such as clips or Slack huddles , channel posting permissions , the sharing and visibility of direct messages including files, or whether and how Authorised Users can connect with other organisations’ Workspaces through Slack Connect. We also follow Customer and Authorised User instructions on how an Authorised User’s profile may be displayed within a Customer’s Workspace or when shared through Slack Connect or other features. Customers may also provide their Authorised Users with the ability to adjust the audience and visibility of certain Customer Data. To learn more, visit our Help Centre to understand what choices and settings are available. Displaying the Services. When an Authorised User submits Information, it may be displayed or discoverable to other Authorised Users in the same or connected Workspaces or Slack Connect instances. For example, an Authorised User’s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile, or other profile and organisational information may be displayed to Authorised Users. Please consult the Help Centre for more information on Services functionality. Collaborating with others. The Services provide different ways for Authorised Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate, such as Slack Connect or email interoperability. Information, such as an Authorised User’s profile and organisational information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the Workspace(s) that you use. For example, depending on the settings of your Workspace, to enable connections with other Authorised Users, your profile may be shared or searchable or discoverable by Authorised Users or other users outside of the Workspace(s) that you belong to, or shared via email when you invite an Authorised User or other user to collaborate via Slack Connect. In many instances, Slack includes either administrator controls or user controls, depending on the use case, with respect to external collaboration. Authorised Users may also decide to expand the visibility of certain content and Customer Data, such as files. Customer access. Owners, administrators, Authorised Users and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify or restrict access to Information. This may include, for example, your employer using features of the Services to access or modify your profile details, or to export logs of Workspace activity. For information about your Workspace settings, please visit https://slack.com/account/settings . Third-party service providers and partners. We may engage third-party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process Information and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services, assist Slack with verifying Owners and Customers, or we may share business information to develop strategic partnerships with Third-Party Service providers to support our common customers. In this respect, depending on the Third-Party Service provided, Slack may share your Information. Additional information about the subprocessors that we use to support delivery of our Services is set forth in the Salesforce Infrastructure and subprocessors documentation . Third-Party Services. A Customer may enable, or permit Authorised Users to enable, Third-Party Services. We require each Third-Party Service provider to disclose all permissions for information accessible through the Services, but we do not guarantee that they do so. When Third-Party Services are enabled by a Customer or an Authorised User, Slack may share Information with Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services are not owned or controlled by Slack and third parties that have been granted access to Information may have their own policies and practices for its collection, use and sharing. Please check the permissions, privacy settings and notices for these Third-Party Services, or contact the provider if you have any questions. Forums. The Information that you choose to provide in a community forum, including personal data, will be publicly available. Organisers and sponsors of events/webinars. If you attend an event or webinar organised by Slack, we may share your profile and organisational information with the event or webinar sponsors when you register, have your badge scanned or join a breakout room. If required by applicable law, you may consent to such sharing via the registration form or by allowing your attendee badge to be scanned at a sponsor booth.

EU / UK Asana has established a comprehensive GDPR/UK GDPR compliance program and is committed to partnering with customers and vendors on our compliance efforts. Some significant steps Asana takes to align its practices with the GDPR/UK GDPR include: Revising our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users to reflect legislative developments; Enhancing our security practices and procedures ; Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share ; Ensuring that we have robust internal privacy and security documentation ; Training employees on global privacy requirements and privacy/security best practices ; and Thoughtfully building a data subject rights policy and response process . APAC The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) is the primary data protection law in Japan that regulates the protection of personal information. It applies to business operators handling personal information of individuals in Japan. The APPI has been amended since it was originally enacted in 2003, with the most recent amendments coming into effect April 1, 2022. Similarly to the distinction between “data controllers” and “data processors” under the GDPR, the APPI makes a distinction between “business operators”—or entities with the authority to control and make decisions about retained personal information (i.e., Asana’s customers) and third-party service providers handling personal information on behalf of a business operator (i.e., Asana). The APPI also imposes restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information outside of Japan. Personal information may be transferred to overseas recipients if there are contractual agreements in place that ensure compliance with data protection standards in Japan. Asana is committed to processing and safeguarding personal information as required by the APPI and its amendments. Asana’s Data Processing Addendum covers Our data protection commitments to ensure that we comply with the APPI; How we will assist our customers with their obligations under the APPI; and The technical and organizational measures implemented to protect personal information. For more information on Asana’s security and data protection practices, please see our Trust Center . U.S. (federal and state) California The CCPA (as amended by CPRA) is a law that provides California consumers certain rights with respect to their personal information. Specifically, the law requires that businesses subject to the statute grant consumers the ability to request access to and deletion of their data, and the ability to opt out of certain types of disclosures of their personal information. The law also restricts how service providers that process personal information on behalf of a business may use that information. Where a business subject to the CCPA has entered into a service or subscription agreement with Asana, Asana will act as a service provider to that business. Specifically, Asana will process such customers’ personal information only for the purposes set forth in the applicable agreement and will cooperate with customers to fulfill their obligations with respect to deletion or access requests. Asana's Data Processing Addendum specifically references our obligations under the CCPA. If your organization is a customer of Asana and requires an addendum, please reach out to dpa@asana.com . HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law in the United States that requires the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. Businesses that are subject to HIPAA can use Asana to support HIPAA-compliant work management. HIPAA compliance for Asana is governed by Asana’s Business Associate Addendum (BAA) . For additional detail on HIPAA and Asana, please refer to the HIPAA Data Sheet . Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. Service providers who are permitted by the financial institutions to access their consumers' nonpublic personal information (NPI) are also required to comply with GLBA. Asana is GLBA-ready and aligns our practices in accordance with GLBA's Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In addition to implementing security safeguards, we only use customer work content to provide our services, and not for any other purpose. Customers should not store sensitive personal data (including financial account numbers and social security numbers) in Asana. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that requires academic institutions like colleges and universities to protect the privacy of student educational records. Asana enables our customers to comply with FERPA by ensuring personal data is kept secure and only used to provide our services as described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement . Asana contractually commits to not disclosing customer data except as directed by the contracting academic institution, as allowed by our terms, or as required by law.

Applicability of this Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy applies to Miro’s online collaboration tools and platform, including the associated Miro mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “ Services ”), miro.com and other Miro websites (collectively, the “ Websites ”) and other interactions (e.g. customer support, the Miro Community, etc.) you may have with Miro, including the processing of any messages, text, files, images, video or audio recordings, or other content submitted through our Services (collectively, “ Customer Content ”).

You, the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) controlling the use of the Services (“ Organization ”) and any associated Customer Content, and any individuals who are granted access to the Services by an Organization (“ Users ” and, collectively with you and an Organization, “ Customer ”) are also bound by the the Terms of Service or the Master Cloud Agreement , as applicable, and any product-specific Terms (together, the “ Customer Agreement” ).

Identifying the Data Controller and Processor Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data.

As the controller, Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to an Organization, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove information and otherwise apply its policies to the Services. As the processor for Customer Content, Miro processes Customer Content that is Personal Data only on Customer’s request and in accordance with Customer’s written instructions, including the applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, Customer’s use of the Services, and as required by applicable law. For more information about how Customer Content is processed (such as how your Personal Data is processed, the purpose and legal basis for processing, and your data subject rights), we refer you to the relevant Customer’s privacy notice.

Steamcommunity,https://steamcommunity.com,https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/,"Home Privacy Policy Agreement Privacy Policy Valve respects the privacy of its online visitors and customers of its products and services and complies with applicable laws for the protection of your privacy, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") and the UK GDPR. Valve and its subsidiary TR Technical Inc. comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Valve has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Valve has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/ . 1. Definitions Wherever we talk about personal data (""Personal Data"") below, we mean any information that can either itself identify you as an individual (""Personally Identifying Information"") or that can be connected to you indirectly by linking it to Personally Identifying Information. Valve also processes anonymous data, aggregated or not, to analyze and produce statistics related to the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of customers as a group or as individuals. Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the customers to which it relates. Valve may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, with third parties. Other capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings defined in the Steam Subscriber Agreement (""SSA""). 2. Why Valve Collects and Processes Data Valve collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons: a) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming service and deliver associated Content and Services; b) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations to keep certain information under tax laws); c) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or d) where you have given consent to it. These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below). 3. The Types and Sources of Data We Collect 3.1 Basic Account Data When setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the ""Steam ID"") that is later used to reference your user account without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you. We do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account. 3.2 Transaction and Payment Data In order to make a transaction on Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services or to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to provide payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date and security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and transmit to the payment service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons. 3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit We will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to us or send it as part of communication with others on Steam, e.g. in Steam Community Forums, chats, or when you provide feedback or other user generated content. This data includes: Information that you post, comment or follow in any of our Content and Services; Information sent through chat; Information you provide when you request information or support from us or purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary to process your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping providers; Information you provide to us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or responding to surveys, e.g. your contact details. 3.4 Your Use of the Steam Client and Websites We collect a variety of information through your general interaction with the websites, Content and Services offered by Steam. Personal Data we collect may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data. Likewise, we will track your process across our websites and applications to verify that you are not a bot and to optimize our services. 3.5 Your Use of Games and other Subscriptions In order to provide you with services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Content and Services. ""Content-Related Information"" includes your Steam ID, as well as what is usually referred to as ""game statistics"". By game statistics we mean information about your games' preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well as information about the device you are using, including what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. 3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies We use ""Cookies"", which are text files placed on your computer, and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to help us analyze how users use our services, as well as to improve the services we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website functionality. The use of Cookies is standard on the internet. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept or not is yours. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. You can manage the use of optional cookies by clicking on the ""Cookies setting"" page accessible via the cookie banner displayed when you first visit our website and at any time through the Cookie Settings page available here . When you visit any of our services, our servers log your IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to the network your computer is part of. 3.7 Content Recommendations We may process information collected under this section 3 so that content, products and services shown on the pages of the Steam store and in update messages displayed when launching the Steam Client can be tailored to meet your needs and populated with relevant recommendations and offers. This is done to improve your customer experience. You can prevent the processing of your data in this way by turning off the automatic loading of the Steam store page and of Steam notifications in the ""Interface"" section of the Steam Client settings. Valve may send you marketing messages about products and services that are similar to goods and services you have previously requested from Valve to your email address or where you have given explicit consent. In such a case we may also use your collected information to customize such marketing messages as well as collect information on whether you opened such messages and which links in their text you followed. You can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time by either withdrawing the consent on the same page where you previously provided it or clicking the ""unsubscribe"" link provided in every marketing email. Alternatively, you can select what kinds of emails you wish to receive on the email setting page . 3.8 Information Required to Detect Violations We collect certain data that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of fraud, cheating and other violations of the SSA and applicable laws (""Violations""). This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation, prevention and, where applicable, acting on of such Violations and stored only for the minimum amount of time needed for this purpose. If the data indicates that a Violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations or until a legal case related to it has been resolved. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you if the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent such Violations. 4. How Long We Store Data We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information is collected and processed or — where the applicable law provides for longer storage and retention period — for the storage and retention period required by law. After that your Personal Data will be deleted, blocked or anonymized, as provided by applicable law. In particular: If you terminate your Steam User Account, your Personal Data will be marked for deletion except to the degree legal requirements or other prevailing legitimate purposes dictate a longer storage. In certain cases, Personal Data cannot be completely deleted in order to ensure the consistency of the gameplay experience or the Steam Community Market. For instance, matches you have played that affect other players' matchmaking data and scores will not be deleted; rather, your connection to these matches will be permanently anonymized. Please note that Valve is required to retain certain transactional data under statutory commercial and tax law for a period of up to ten (10) years. If you withdraw your consent on which a processing of your Personal Data or of the Personal Data of your child is based, we will delete your Personal Data or respectively the Personal Data of your child without undue delay to the extent that the collection and processing of the Personal Data was based on the withdrawn consent. If you exercise a right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, we will review your objection and delete your Personal Data that we processed for the purpose to which you objected without undue delay, unless another legal basis for processing and retaining this data exists or unless applicable law requires us to retain the data. 5. Who Has Access to Data Valve does not sell Personal Data. However, we may share or provide access to each of the categories of Personal Data we collect as necessary for the following business purposes. 5.1 Valve and its subsidiaries may share your Personal Data with each other and use it to the degree necessary to achieve the purposes listed in section 2 above. In the event of a reorganization, sale or merger we may transfer Personal Data to the relevant third party subject to applicable laws, the Principles and liability requirements under the DPF. 5.2 We may also share your Personal Data with our third party service providers that provide customer support services in connection with goods, Content and Services distributed via Steam. Your Personal Data will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and only as far as this is necessary for performing customer support services. Valve complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU, Switzerland, and the UK, including the provisions governing onward transfer liability. 5.3 In accordance with internet standards, we may also share certain information (including your IP address and the identification of Steam content you wish to access) with our third party network providers that provide content delivery network services and game server services in connection with Steam. Our content delivery network providers enable the delivery of digital content you have requested, e.g. when using Steam, by using a system of distributed servers that deliver the content to you, based on your geographic location. 5.4 We make certain data related to your Steam User Account available to other players and our partners through the Steamworks API. This information can be accessed by anyone by querying your Steam ID. At a minimum, the public persona name you have chosen to represent you on Steam and your Avatar picture are accessible this way, as well as whether you have received a ban for cheating in a multiplayer game. The accessibility of any additional info about you can be controlled through your Steam Community user profile page; data publicly available on your profile page can be accessed automatically through the Steamworks API. In addition to the publicly available information, game developers and publishers have access to certain information from the Steamworks API directly relating to the users of the games they operate. This information includes as a minimum your ownership of the game in question. Depending on which Steamworks services are implemented in the game it may also include leaderboard information, your progress in the game, achievements you have completed, your multiplayer game matchmaking information, in-game items and other information needed to operate the game and provide support for it. For more information on what Steamworks services a specific game has implemented, please review its store page. While we do not knowingly share Personally Identifying Information about you through the Steamworks API such as your real name or your email address, any information you share about yourself on your public Steam Profile can be accessed through the Steamworks API, including information that may make you identifiable. 5.5 The Steam community includes message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your Personal Data is posted on one of our community forums against your will, please use the reporting function and the Steam help site to request its removal. 5.6 Valve may allow you to link your Steam User Account to an account offered by a third party. If you consent to link the accounts, Valve may collect and combine information you allowed Valve to receive from a third party with information of your Steam User Account to the degree allowed by your consent at the time. If the linking of the accounts requires the transmission of information about your person from Valve to a third party, you will be informed about it before the linking takes place and you will be given the opportunity to consent to the linking and the transmission of your information. The third party's use of your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy, which we encourage you to review. 5.7 Valve may release Personal Data to comply with court orders or laws and regulations that require us to disclose such information. 6. Your Rights and Control Mechanisms The data protection laws of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, California, and other territories grant their residents certain rights in relation to their Personal Data. While other jurisdictions may provide fewer statutory rights, we make the tools designed to exercise such rights available to our customers worldwide. (When we talk about the GDPR in this section, we mean the version of the GDPR that applies to you in the EU or UK). To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we are providing a dedicated section on the Steam support page (the ""Privacy Dashboard""). This gives you access to your Personal Data, allows you to rectify and delete it where necessary and to object to its use where you feel necessary. To access it, log into the Steam support page at https://help.steampowered.com and choose the menu items My Account -> Data Related to Your Steam Account. In most cases, you can access, manage, or delete Personal Data in the Privacy Dashboard, but you may also contact Valve with questions or requests via the contact processes described in sections 8 and 10 below. As a visitor to the Steam Website without being logged in, you can control Cookies through the process described in section 3.6 above. You can also contact Valve or its European representative through the contact info provided in section 8. below to exercise your rights or use this web form. As a resident of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland you have the following rights in relation to your Personal Data: 6.1 Right of Access. You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the Privacy Dashboard. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. 6.2 Right to Rectification. If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavor to ensure by implementing suitable measures that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided via the Privacy Dashboard. 6.3. Right to Erasure. You have the right to obtain deletion of Personal Data concerning you if the reason why we could collect it (see section 2. above) does not exist anymore or if there is another legal ground for its deletion. For individual items of Personal Data please edit them through the Privacy Dashboard or request the deletion via the Steam support page. You can also request the deletion of your Steam user account via the Steam support page. As a result of deleting your Steam User Account, you will lose access to Steam services, including the Steam User Account, Subscriptions and game-related information linked to the Steam User Account and the possibility to access other services you are using the Steam User Account for. We allow you to restore your Steam User Account during a grace period of 30 (thirty) days from the moment you request deletion of your Steam User Account. This functionality allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Steam User Account deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted subject to section 4. above. In some cases, deletion of your Steam User Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if your account has a business relationship with Valve, such as due to your work for a game developer, you will only be able to delete your Steam User Account after you have transferred this role to another user or have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months. 6.4 Right to Object. When our processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR / section 2.c) of this Privacy Policy, you have the right to object to this processing. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing as described in Article 21 of the GDPR; in particular if the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority. 6.5 Right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data You have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your Personal Data under the conditions set out in article 18 of the GDPR. 6.6 Right to Personal Data portability You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller under the conditions set out in article 20 of the GDPR. Valve makes your Personal Data available in structured HTML format through the Privacy Dashboard as described above. 6.7 Right to Post-Mortem Control of Your Personal Data If French data protection legislation is applicable to you, you have the right to establish guidelines for the preservation, the deletion and the transmission of Personal Data after your death in accordance with article 40-1 of the Act No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information, Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties. 6.8 Arbitration If Valve does not resolve any claimed violations of the Principles by any other DPF mechanism or by your rights under this section, you have � in accordance with the requirements of Annex I to the DPF � the possibility to invoke binding arbitration before the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Panel. 7. Children The minimum age to create a Steam User Account is 13. Valve will not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under this age. Where certain countries apply a higher age of consent for the collection of Personal Data, Valve requires parental consent before a Steam User Account can be created and Personal Data associated with it collected. Valve encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out personal information when online. 8. Contact Info You can contact Valve's data protection officer at the address below. While we review any request sent by mail, please be aware that to combat fraud, harassment and identity theft, the only way to access, rectify or delete your data is through logging in with your Steam User Account at http://help.steampowered.com and selecting the menu items -> My Account -> View Account Data . In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Valve commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.

If GOG services crash, we might ask you to send us crash logs/bug reports. 4.5 A quick word about payment details (if/when you use them in GOG services): this is a matter for the relevant payment method/platform/processor. We process only limited payment processing information on a hashed/anonymised basis as applicable.

When you register for GOG services via Facebook Connect (of course, it's optional), Facebook will provide us with certain information about you such as your Facebook ID, avatar, e-mail, gender, location and friend list. Data is gathered strictly in accordance with the social network(s)’ terms and conditions, so check your privacy settings on Facebook. 5.3 GOG GALAXY. If you use GOG GALAXY and decide to connect your accounts from other platforms with GOG GALAXY Application using GOG official or community integrations, then we may also collect personal and non-personal information via such integrations (see section 4.3 above for details). This feature is totally optional. Please know that community integrations may be governed by separate private policies and we are not responsible for their use of your personal and non-personal information (see further section 5 of the GOG GALAXY Licence Agreement). If you use GOG GALAXY and choose to link your accounts from other platforms to GOG GALAXY we may collect your personal and non-personal information from third parties via GOG official or community integrations (see details opposite). 6. COOKIES We also collect information about you via cookies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Policy here . You can also manage your consents in our Cookie Declaration which you can find in the footnote of our website. The Cookie Policy and Cookie Declaration are a part of this Privacy Policy. Check out our Cookie Policy and Cookie Declaration (links opposite). 7. WHY DO WE USE YOUR DATA? (LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DATA PROCESSING) 7.1. When we process information about you, we do so as necessary to provide GOG services you use (i.e. to perform agreement between us, enable you to play GWENT or use GOG GALAXY features), meet our legal obligations (f.ex. tax, accounting) or to fulfill the so-called “legitimate interests” of GOG or other reasons described in the “How we use your data” section. To clarify, by legitimate interests we mean lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected (like informing you about games we distribute and making sure our marketing is relevant for you, protecting the security of our websites and systems, conducting anti-cheat analysis and anti-fraud checks). When we rely on the legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes we will ask for your consent and you will be entitled to withdraw this consent any time, with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn. In essence, we process your data to provide you with GOG services, to meet our legal obligations and for other reasons that are important for us like informing you about our games and ensuring security of our website. In other cases, we will ask for your consent in advance and you will always have the right to withdraw it anytime you like. 7.2 When we transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area, we do so on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “Trusted Partners”. 8. HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION 8.1 All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our Trusted Partners. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. All information you provide to us is stored either on our secure servers or those of our Trusted Partners. 8.2 How long are we going to keep your data? We will retain your personal information only for as long as we will be required in order to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain special cases, a longer retention period might be required by law e.g. tax, accounting purposes or other legal requirements and obligations. As soon as we will no longer require your personal data to provide our services for other purposes mentioned above, we will promptly delete or anonymize it. In particular: (a) we will keep information that is associated with your GOG account for the duration of your agreement for the access to GOG services (i.e. until you close your GOG account). If you choose to close your GOG account, limited data that we collect about you may still be retained for tax, legal and accounting purposes; (b) if you don’t have a GOG account and contact us we will retain correspondence with you as long as necessary to help you out and then for the period necessary for legal or accountability purposes; (c) information that you post on our public forums and your game reviews will be retained until you decide that it should be removed as well. We don’t want to interfere with your posts and expressions without your permission. (d) if you use GOG GALAXY and connect your accounts from other platforms with GOG GALAXY we’ll be storing your imported data only as long as you stay connected with the relevant platform. This information will be deleted once you disconnect with the platform or anytime you ask us to delete your data. However, if you purchased any content via GOG GALAXY Store, we will need to retain your payment history, product ID and entitlement ID for tax, legal and accounting purposes. In general, we’ll store your data until you close your GOG account. If you do, we may still use limited information about you for tax, legal or accounting purposes. 9. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION 9.1 We will use the above information in the following ways: (a) to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us, like providing access to your GOG account, providing you with the games and technical support and in general allowing to use GOG services and its functionalities when you choose to do so f. ex. your GOG user profile, chat, forum or cloud saving and crossplay services in GOG GALAXY; (b) to ensure that GOG services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or other device from which you access GOG services; (c) to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us and which we feel may interest you - in particular, we may send you newsletters or emails about GOG services, special and occasional offers like a welcome offer or provide you with ads, offers and product recommendations on the basis of your purchases or activity on our and third party websites and services, as well as about CD PROJEKT’s games and services (of course, it’s optional) (d) to activate content on your GOG account through our Direct to Account API; (e) to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing actions and improve the quality of our marketing; (f) to notify you about changes to GOG services and our legal documents; (g) to improve or modify GOG services, f.ex. based on which games you like, how you play them, reported problems, your suggestions or satisfaction surveys; (h) to improve or modify GOG services, for example based on which games you like more and how you play them; (i) to calculate conversion rates and other elements of GOG.COM performance; (j) in connection with the services of our Trusted Partners, such as payment processors, located in and outside the EU, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services; (k) to provide you with optional functionalities such as authentication via Facebook account; (l) to create a universal user’s profile based on information about your use of GOG services and other platforms (we’ll rely on data made available when you merge your GOG account with your account on other platforms) in order to make our Services even more interesting for you; (m) to protect you from an unauthorized use of your account and against fraud; (n) for tax, legal and accounting purposes; (o) for the accountability purposes as defined by EU legislation (GDPR); and (p) to provide you with GOG GALAXY features if you decide to use it f.ex. to allow you to organize your game libraries as one master collection together with playtime and achievements, to create one list of your gaming friends with the ability to chat with them cross-platform and to activate your purchased content on that external platform; We will use your information to run GOG and keep improving it as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails). Sometimes we may have to share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types in order to run GOG services. 9.2. Whenever we’re personalizing or targeting our marketing communications, offers and adverts, we may profile your personal information. However, we do not make automated decisions (f.ex. via algorithms) that could affect your legal situation. If you decide that you no longer want to receive personalized offers, product recommendations from us, or no advertising news at all, you can object to this at any time. You can also choose whether to receive marketing communication from us, including personalized and targeted marketing emails by managing subscriptions on your GOG Account Subscription page, following the link ""unsubscribe"" attached to our marketing emails or just contacting us directly here. 9.3 Non-personal data. We might process some aggregated and general non-personal data on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region, number of support tickets) and share it with Trusted Partners who work with us to provide GOG services to you (for example, with games developers/publishers selling games on GOG.COM or with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend GOG services or to help them to improve their products, which you have bought. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run GOG.COM. Fear not, as mentioned above, everything’s anonymised, so you cannot be identified. 10. DATA SHARINGS Other Users 10.1 Some elements of your personal information and some information about your use of GOG services are accessible to other GOG users. For example: other users of GOG services will be able to see your username and avatar (if you choose to have one). We may also display other information derived from your activity on GOG services.

Some information about you will be visible on GOG.COM as a part of your GOG user profile, this can be managed via privacy settings for your GOG account. 10.2 How you use your information. Please remember that any communications you have via GOG services (e.g. via private messages, chat or the GOG forums or via multiplayer games like GWENT) may reveal your screen name, other details about you and the content of any communications by you with other users. Also, any information and content you share publicly using GOG services (e.g. on our forums or your GOG user profile) will be accessible to GOG users and others. Consider carefully with whom you share your information and avoid sharing contact or private information about yourself. When you're using GOG services you can choose to share your own personal information with others (e.g. in chat) but it's your responsibility. Our Trusted Partners 10.3. In general, we do not disclose information about you to third parties without your consent. We may share your data only with the following categories of third parties who were engaged by us to help deliver our services and functionalities to you (they are formally called “Data Processors”).

Privacy laws in these countries may not offer the same level of protection as in your country or in the EEA. But whenever we’re sharing your personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses and/or other lawful measures to transfer your data and establish adequate protection of your personal information 11. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND EXTERNAL SERVICES 11.1 GOG services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties (e.g. to games developers whose games are on GOG). In addition, third parties (e.g. games developers/publishers) may also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. your email address or name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. This may include saving information to your GOG profile in relation to their games (such as, for example, saving game progress). Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies. This also applies to GOG GALAXY integrations created by the community. You may find links on GOG.COM that lead outside our website. Sometimes we might need to direct you elsewhere (like a developer’s website) if you want to access additional features built into your games. These sites might collect your information under their own privacy policies. 11.2 GOG services may also offer you easy and optional access to GOG-approved Trusted Partners’ services, e.g. the websites and games provided by our related company CD PROJEKT. In order to do this, we will need to share some of your personal information (e.g. your email address) with them, as long as you agree to it. This personal information will be protected under our Trusted Partner’s privacy policy. You can use GOG services to access cool stuff from GOG-approved Trusted Partners. We will need to share some personal information with them (which you control). It is up to you if you want to use your GOG account for this or not. 12. OTHER STUFF 12.1 Please be aware that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to release personal information to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements. We might be required to comply with law enforcement requests to release personal information. 12.2 In the unlikely event of a reorganisation or merger of GOG or GOG accounts we may transfer personally identifiable information to an involved third party who will protect this to at least the same level as we do in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of any reorganisations, acquisitions, etc., your personal information will be protected the same way as it is right now. Fear not! 13. YOUR RIGHTS 13.1 You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain situations f.ex. for marketing purposes at any time.

In some cases, the disclosure described above may result in your Personal Info being transferred internationally, including from the European Economic Area to a country outside it. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Info will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to countries for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision. The Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided to you upon request to dpo@riotgames.com .
